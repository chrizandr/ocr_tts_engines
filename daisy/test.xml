    PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION, page no: 5
</h1>

<p>
    The Methodology of Research is a course of study in several Master level programs like M.A.,
M.B.A., M.-S.W., M.Com., etc. and also for M.Phil., M.S., and Ph.D. in all social sciences in most
of the universities. It is also a course of study in professional diploma courses like D.B.A., D.P. .M., D.I.M. offered by universities and professional bodies.
</p>

<p>
    The course in Methodology of Research is often a problem course to both the faculty and the
students, because there is no single comprehensive publication that is integrated in concept, sufficient
in scope and coverage and challenge to serve as the basic text for such a course. There are, of Course,
a few good publications on methodology of research, but they are mostly discipline specific and do
not cover all aspects of methodology and statistical analysis.
</p>

<p>
    The research students’ ordeal is far more severe. They mostly grope in dark and struggle and
waste a lot of time and effort without exactly knowing how to go about in each stage of research work
— from selection of the problem through report writing. In fact, they need specific guidelines on
various research techniques with illustrations drawn from actual research studies, for planning and
carrying out their research projects.
</p>

  <p>
    The book is a response to the above perceived needs for a cross- discipline practice- oriented
comprehensive book on research methodology. It has grown out of my long and rich experience in
guiding and evaluating research projects at Master, M.Phil. and Doctoral levels, in directing sponsored
projects, in teaching methodology of research to the Master and Doctoral students over three decades,
and in directing workshops on methodology of research for Doctoral research scholars and teachers.
</p>

   <p>
    The objective of this book is to serve as a textbook for courses in Research Methodology in
social sciences and also to serve as a handbook for research scholars.
</p>

<p>
    This book has several distinctive features. It _

 is suitable for all social sciences: Economics, Commerce, Management, Sociology,
Psychology, Behavioural Science, Education, Political Science, Social Work, etc.,

 adequately— covers all aspects of research methodology: Scientific method, conceptual models,
social science research, types and methods of research, review of literature and note— taking,
selection of a research problem, hypotheses, concepts, measurement, research plan, sampling
techniques and sample size, methods of collection of data, construction of questionnaire and -
scales/ ﬁeld work, processing and tabulation of data, graphic representation, statistical analysis
of data and :hypothesis testing and report writing and evaluation,

 provides step - by -step guidelines on all aspects of the research process,

 illustrates the various research strategies and techniques with examples drawn from recent
research publications in various social sciences, and

 written in simple and interesting style.

</p>

<p>
    The book is organized into twelve chapters. In each chapter, the concepts are exactly defined,
the techniques and processes are described with operational guidelines and illustrations, and suggested
readings and review questions and exercises are listed.

<p>
	I owe an incalculable debt to the many pioneers of research- methodology in social sciences
whose contributions have enriched my knowledge of research methodology. I would like to express
special thanks to the hundreds of students who, over the years, have struggled in learning   methodology,
and in carrying out research studies. It is their difficulties, and the methodological flaws and
imperfections found in the hundreds of project reports and dissertations which I have evaluated over
the years, which had prompted me to write this book.

</p>
<p>
	I am also grateful to my old students Dr. M. Ranganathan, Associate Professor of Commerce,
University of Madras, Dr. A. John Winfred, Professor of Cooperation, Sri Ramakrishna Mission
Vidyalaya Autonomous Arts College, and. Dr. N. Narayanaswamy, Assistant Professor, Gandhigram
Rural University for their assistance in collecting case illustrations from published studies.

</p>
<p>
	Among my colleagues at the Indian Institute of Science, Prof. A. K. N. Reddy, Chairman,
Department of Management Studies has been especially helpful and encouraging. Prof.
B.G. Raghavendra critiqued the chapter on Statistical Analysis and offered valuable suggestions for
improving it.
</p>

<p>
	I gratefully acknowledge a lump- sum grant granted by the University Grants Commission, New
Delhi, which covered some of the travel, stationery, typing and duplicating expenses.

</p>
<p>
	Finally, I would like to express my thanks to my old student Dr. B.C. Sanjeevaiah and my
beloved daughter, Meera, who organised typing and xeroxing work, and to Mrs. Sheela,
Mr. K. Ramakrishnan and Mr. Eswarachari who typed the manuscript with skill and great patience.

</p>
<p>
	Above all, I am grateful to God for His blessings and grace and I dedicate this humble publication
to His Lotus Feet as an offering unto Him.

<h1>
	                  1.1 WHAT IS RESEARCH?
</h1>

<h1>
Introduction
</h1>

<p>
	Curiosity or inquisitiveness is a distinctive feature of human beings. Curiosity to know about
ourselves, our institutions, our environment, our planet, other planets, and the universe is inherent in
us. Innumerable questions go on arising in our mind: What are the parameters of sound health of a
person? How do problems of health arise? What are the remedies? What is the shape of the earth?
How do solar and lunar eclipses arise? How is rain formed? Why are places like Ootacamund, Simla
cooler than their nearby places? Is there any life in other planets? What are stars? Why day and night
alternate? Why the mode of life and activities of human beings vary from place to place? Why there
is no communal harmony in certain places? Why there is abject poverty in some countries like India
and African countries? Why does the performance of similar organizations vary? What are the causes
of various business problems like recession or industrial unrest? And so on. Whenever such questions
arise we seek answers to them. Whenever we encounter problems, we try to find solutions to them.
Seeking answers to questions and finding solutions to problems have been the basis of human
progress. A systematic search for an answer to a question or a solution to a problem is called research.
</p>

<h1>
Definition of Research
</h1>

<p>
	Research simply means a search for facts — answers to questions and solutions to problems.
It is a purposive investigation. It is an “organized inquiry. ”  It seeks to find explanations to unexplained
phenomenon, to clarify the doubtful propositions and to correct the misconceived facts. How is this
search made? What are possible methods or approaches?

</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00012">12</pagenum>


<h1>
	2       METHODOLOGY OF RESEARCH IN SOCIAL SCIENCES, page no:12
</h1>

 <p>
	The search for facts may be made through either (a) arbitrary (or unscientific) method or
(b) scientific method.
</p>

<p>
		Arbitrary method: Arbitrary method of seeking answers to questions is based on imagination,
opinion, blind belief or impression. For example, ii was believed that the shape of the earth was ﬂat;
a big snake swallows the sun or moon causing solar or lunar eclipse. Similarly, we form our own
impressions about various phenomena and issues.

 The arbitrary method suffers from serious weaknesses or drawbacks. It is subjective, the finding
will vary from person to person depending on his impression or imagination. It is vague and inaccurate.
</p>

<p>
	Scientific method; This is a systematic rational approach to seeking facts. It eliminated the .
drawbacks of the arbitrary method. It is objective, precise, and arrives at conclusions on the basis of
verifiable evidences. (For details, see topic 1.2 Scientific method, below.)
</p>

<p>
	Therefore, search for facts Should be made by scientific method rather than by arbitrary method.
Then only we may get verifiable and accurate facts. Hence Research is a systematic and logical study
of an issue or problem or phenomenon through scientific method. An analysis of the definitions given
by notable authorities may reveal the proper meaning and nature of the concept of research.

</p>
 <p>
	Kerlinger defines research as a “systematic, controlled, empirical and critical investigation of
hypothetical propositions about the presumed relations among natural phenomena.”2 The term
“systematic, controlled, empirical and critical” describe the characteristics of scientific method. Whether
research needs to be an “investigation of hypothetical propositions about presumed relations” is
debatable. Research does not always call for a hypothesis. It. may also be carried out for the formulation
of hypotheses. It may also be designed to gather descriptive information on a phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
    Emory defines research as “any organized inquiry designed and carried out to provide information for solving a problem. ”3 This definition is an inclusive one. But it emphasizes the problem- solving
purpose only. Research may also aim at finding answer to questions.

</p>
<p>
	The Encyclopedia of Social Sciences4 defines research as “the manipulation of generalizing to
extend, correct or verify knowledge...” This definition highlights the primary purpose of research,
viz., arriving at generalization and the method of manipulation, which 1s an aspect of experimentation
 adopted for the purpose.
</p>
<p>
	Best endorses the above purpose and method of research in his definition of research: “the
systematic and objective analysis and recording of controlled Observations that may lead to the
development of generalizations, principles or theories, resulting in prediction and possibly ultimate
control of events. ”5
</p>

<p>
	According to Black and Champion, “Scientific research consists of obtaining information through
empirical observation that can be used for the systematic development of logically related propoSitions
attempting to establish casual relations among variables.”6

</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00013">13</pagenum>


 <h1>
	                 FOUNDATIONS OF RESEARCH, page no:13
</h1>

<p>
	Clover and Balsley define research as “the process of systematically obtaining. accurate answers
to significant and pertinent questions by the use of the scientific method of gathering and interpreting
information.”7 This simple definition refers to the systematic approach and scientific method to be
adopted for finding answers to pertinent questions.

</p>
<p>
	Young defines Research as “a scientific undertaking which, by means of logical and systematic
techniques, aims to: (1)discover new facts or verify and test old facts, (2) analyse their sequence,
interrelationships and causal explanations, (3) develop new scientific tools, concepts and theories
which would facilitate reliable and valid study of human behaviour.”8 This exhaustive all- inclusive
definition speciﬁes all the major aims of research, viz., discovery of new facts, verification and testing
of old facts, analysis of interrelationships and causal explanations and development of new tools,
concepts and theories.
</p>

<h1>
	Characteristics of Research
</h1>
<p>
	The above definitions reveal the various characteristics of research:

1. Research is a systematic and critical investigation into a phenomenon.

2. It is not a mere compilation, but a purposive investigation; it aims at describing, interpreting
- and explaining a phenomenon.

3. It adopts scientific method.

4. It is objective and logical, applying possible tests to validate the measuring tools and the
   Conclusions reached.

5. It is based upon observable experience or empirical evidence.

6. Research is directed towards finding answers to pertinent questions and solutions to problems.

7. It emphasizes the development of generalization, principles or theories.

8. The purpose of research IS not to arrive at an answer, which is personally pleasing to the
   researcher, but rather one, which will stand up the test of criticism.9
</p>

<h1>
	Objectives or Purposes of Research
</h1>

<p>
	The objectives or purposes of research are varied. They are:

1. Research extends knowledge of human beings, social life and environment. Scientists and
  researchers build up the wealth of knowledge through their research findings. They search
  answers for various types of questions: What, Where, When, How and Why of various
  phenomena, and enlighten us. The bodies of knowledge have been developed by research
  in general and pure or fundamental research in particular.

2. Research unravels the" mysteries of nature; brings to light hidden information that might
   never be discovered fully during the ordinary course of life.

3. Research establishes generalizations and general laws and contributes to theory building in
   various fields of knowledge. Our knowledge of isolated events is connected together to
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00014">14</pagenum>


<h1>
	        METHODOLOGY OF RESEARCH IN SOCIAL SCIENCES, page no:14
</h1>

<p>
	draw generalizations and general laws. Law of gravitation, Law of demand, and principles
of organization such as unity of command and scalar principle, the theory of consumer
behaviour and motivation theories are some examples for such generalizations, laws and
theories.
</p>
<p>
4. Research verifies and tests existing facts and theory and these help improving our knowledge
and ability to handle situations and events. Merton argues: “ Empirical research goes far
beyond the passive role of verifying and testing theory... Research plays an active role, it
performs at least four major functions. It initiates, it formulates, it deflects, and it clarifies
theory.”10

5. General laws developed through research may enable us to make reliable predictions of
events yet to happen.

6. Research aims to analyse inter-relationships between variables and to derive causal
explanations; and thus enables us to have a better understanding of the world in which we
live.

7. Applied research aims at finding solutions to problems... socio-economic problems (e.g.,
social unrest, unemployment, poverty) health problems, human relations problems in
organizations and so on. Thanks to the fruits of research, we have better quality of life,
longer life span and better control over events.

8. Research also aims at developing new tools, concepts, and theories for a better study of
unknown phenomena.

9. Research aids planning and thus contributes to national development. Research — social
science research in particular — aids planning in the following ways:
</p>
<p>
	Research brings out factual data on prevailing situations and problems for drawing up plans and
schemes on a realistic basis. Research uncovers needed facts on which sound decisions can be made
before committing resources. Studies open up the possibility of testing the validity of planning
assumptions or premises. For example, in the first four Five Year Plans of India it was assumed that
a fast rate of the general economic growth will by itself create fuller employment and produce higher
living standards for the poor through the ‘trickle down’ effect of such growth. Evaluation studies have
shown that this assumption was not correct and the strategy of development in the Fifth and subsequent
Five Year Plans was modified, providing for special and deliberate programmes for eradication of
poverty in rural areas.
</p>

<p>
	Research studies enable the planners to evaluate alternative strategies and choose the most
appropriate strategies for development of the various sectors like agriculture, industry, education,
health, social welfare etc.
</p>

<p>
	The benefit- cost evaluation studies of projects like irrigation projects throw out valuable lessons
for improving the formulation of similar projects subsequently.
</p>

<p>
	Evaluation studies of on-going programmes like family planning schemes, lead bank schemes,
Integrated Rural Development Programme etc., point out their shortcomings and implementation
problems and enable the planners to revise the schemes and implementation strategies appropriately.

</p>

<h1>
	                   FOUNDATIONS OF RESEARCH, page no:15
</h1>

<p>
	The dissemination of research finding creates a general awareness of the country’ s current
situations and problems among the public, which inspire them to participate in formulation and
implementation of development schemes.

The above possibilities can be realized provided social science research is geared to planning
needs and the planners are responsive and sensitive to the research findings.11

<h1>
	                   1.2 SCIENTIFIC METHOD
</h1>

<h1>
Meaning
</h1>

<p>
	Research is a scientific endeavour. It involves scientific method. “The scientific method is a
systematic step— by- step procedure following the logical processes of reasoning.”12 Scientific method
is a means for gaining knowledge of the universe. As Karl Pearson emphasizes “the scientific method
is one and same in all branches and that method of all logically trained minds... the unity of all
sciences consists alone in their method not in their materials; the man who classifies facts of any kind
whatever, who sees their mutual relation describes their sequence is a man of science.”13 The facts
may be related to any field. “It is not the facts themselves which make science”14 but the method by
which they are dealt with. “Science is not wrapped up with any particular body of facts.”15 Science
is independent of any particular subject matter. “It deals with knowable universe for its subject. It
deals with physical as well as psychological processes, with man. as much as with nature. It has to
do with everything to which its method can be applied. What makes a science is not, of course, the
nature of things with which it is concerned, but the method by which it deals with these things.”16 Thus,
the scientific method does not refer to a field of specific subject of matter, but rather to a procedure
or mode of investigation. It is “an objective, logical and systematic method of analysis of phenomena,
devised to permit the accumulation of reliable knowledge. It is a systematized form of analysis17 ...It
is characterized by an intellectual attitude. (See “Scientific attitude”, last part of this section, below).
</p>

<h1>
	Basis of Scientific Method
</h1>

<p>
The scientific method is based on certain “articles of faith” these are:-
  > reliance on empirical evidence
  > use of relevant concepts
  > commitment to objectivity
  > ethical neutrality
</p>

  <p>
   > generalization
   > verifiability
   > logical reasoning process
</p>

<p>
	Reliance on evidence: Truth is established on the basis of evidence. Conclusion is admitted,
only when it is based on evidence. Scientific method involves a systematic process. The answer to
a question is not decided by intuition or imagination. Relevant data are collected through observation
 or; experimentation. The, validity and the reliability18 of data are checked carefully and the data are
analysed thoroughly, using appropriate methods of analysis. Conclusion is reached on the basis of the
result of analysis.
</p>

<p>
	 Use of concepts: We experience a vast number of facts through our senses. Facts are things,
Which actually exist. In order to deal with them, we use concepts with specific meanings. Concepts19
 are logical constructs or abstractions created from sense impressions, percepts and experiences. They
are symbols representing the meaning that we hold. We use them in our thinking and communication.
Otherwise clarity and correct understanding cannot be achieved.
</p>
<p>
	Commitment to objectivity: Objectivity is the hallmark of the scientific method. It means
forming a judgement upon facts unbiased by, personal impressions. According to Green “Objectivity
is the willingness and ability to examine evidence dispassionately.” The conclusion should not vary
from person to person. It should be the same for all persons. A person of science must “above all
things... strive at self- elimination in his judgement and provide an argument which is as true for each
individual mind as his own.”20
</p>

<p>
	Ethical neutrality: Science does not pass normatiVe judgement on facts. It does not say that
they are good or bad. As schroedniger says, “science never imposes anything, science states. Science .
aims at nothing but making true and adequate statements about its objects.”21

</p>

<p>
	 Generalization: Scientists are not concerned with isolated events, but with the commonality of a series of event. They aim at discovering “under the surface layer of diversity the thread of uniformity.
Around a discovered uniformity a logical class and its observed pattern, a descriptive generalization
is formulated.22 In formulating a generalization, we should avoid the danger of committing the
particularistic fallacy,23 which arises through an inclination to generalize on insufficient or incomplete
and unrelated data. This can be avoided by the accumulation of a large body of data and by the
employment of comparisons and control groups.
</p>

<p>
	Verifiability: The conclusions arrived at by a scientist should be verifiable. He must make
known to others how he arrived at his conclusions. He should thus expose his own methods and ;
conclusions to critical scrutiny. When others test his conclusion under the same conditions, then it is
accepted as correct. Such verification through replication may either confirm established conclusions
or modify them or even invalidate them. For example, originally an atom was considered to be

<h1>
	            FOUNDATIONS OF RESEARCH ,page no:17
</h1>

<p>
	indivisible, but subsequent researches have proved that it is divisible and thus provided the basis for
developing atomic energy.
</p>

<p>
	Logical reasoning process: The scientific method involves the logical process of reasoning.
This reasoning process is used for drawing inference from the finding of a study or for arriving at
conclusion. For example, in a survey of the expenditure pattern on basic necessaries forms a very high
proportion of the total expenditure, it is concluded that lower the household income, the higher is the
proportion spent on basic necessaries. The logical reasoning process consists of induction and deduction.
</p>

<h1>
Induction
</h1>

<p>
	Meaning: Induction is one of the methods of logical reasoning process. The inductive method
consists of studying several individual cases and drawing a generalization. Therefore, induction
involves two processes — observation and generalization. Conclusions from induction are tentative
inferences and they are subject to further confirmation based on more evidence.
</p>

<p>
	When followed: This method is followed when new facts are studied, new truths are uncovered
and new generalizations are formulated from a research project. For example, in a farm management
study it is proposed to test the hypothesis: “The application of recommended dosage of chemical
fertilizers results in an increase in the yield per hectare.” A sample of experimental farms and control
farms is selected in an area. In the experimental farms, chemical fertilizer is applied and in controlled

farms it is not applied, but other conditions — quality of seeds, irrigation, cultural practice, etc., - are
the same. After the harvest the average yield per hectare is computed for experimental and control
groups and the hypothesis is tested. The inductive method of reasoning is used in the analysis.
</p>

<p>
	Essential conditions: Four conditions24 are essential to satisfactory induction. They are:

1. Observation must be correctly performed and recorded, data collected should be accurate.
Mistakes in conducting experiments or interviews and faulty recordings of the information
can vitiate the value of any, conclusions reached.

2. Observations must cover representative cases drawn from a specific universe. For instance,
in a survey of job- satisfaction of bank executives the universe from which a sample has to
be drawn should be defined exactly, say officers of public sector banks in a specific
geographical area and all cadres of officers should be included in, the sample and an
appropriate sampling method like stratified random sampling has to be adopted.

3. Observations must cover an adequate number of cases. The size of the sample must be
large enough to make it representative and to get reliable result. (See chapter 6, section-4).

4. Conclusion must be conﬁned to inferences drawn from the findings. Conclusions reached
after an analysis of data collected on a given study must be conﬁned to the inferences drawn
from the findings only. They should not be generalized to apply to types of cases not
covered in the sample.

Types of induction: Theodorson and Theodorson25 have identified two basic types of induction,
viz., enumerative and analytic.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00018">18</pagenum>

  <h1>
	  page no:18
</h1>

<p>
	Enumerative induction is the most common form of induction used in social science research.
In general, this type of induction involves generalization from samples and the generalizations are
usually derived through the analysis of data.

Analytic induction involves case— by- case analysis of specific features. Cressy26 outlined the
step- by- step procedure of analytic induction:
</p>

<p>
1. Deﬁne the phenomenon to be explained.

2. Formulate hypothesis to explain the phenomenon.

3. Study a case to determine whether hypothesis ﬁts in the case.

4. If the hypothesis does not fit the facts, either reformulate the hypothesis or redefine the
phenomenon so that the case is excluded. (This definition must be more precise than the
first one).

5. Examine a small number of cases to attain practical certainty; but whenever a negative case
disproving the explanation is discovered, reformulate the hypothesis.

6. Continue this procedure of examining cases, redefining the phenomenon and reformulating
the hypothesis, until a universal relationship is established.

7. For purposes of proof, examine cases outside the area circumscribed by the definition to
determine whether or not the final hypothesis applies to them.
</p>

<h1>
	Deduction
</h1>

<p>
	Meaning: Deduction is reasoning process of applying a general accepted principle to a specific
individual case falling under the general principle. It is regarded “as reasoning from the general to
the particular.”27 This reasoning establishes a “logical relationship between a major premise, a minor
premise and a conclusion.”28 A major premise is a previously established generalization or assumption;
a minor premise is a particular case related to the major premise. The logical relationship of these
premises lead to conclusion, e. g.,

Major premise                                      All men are mortal.
Minor premise                                      A is a man.
Conclusion                                         A is mortal.

Use: This deductive method of moving from the general assumption to the specific application
is useful for solving problems. But it is not useful in arriving at new truths. The inductive process
overcomes this limitation of deductive process.

Essential conditions: The conditions necessary for valid deduction are:
l. The general rule or assumption must be correct.
2. The general rule must be applied only to the cases, which properly fall under it.

The general rule or the major premise must be correct. If it is not correct, then the conclusion
cannot be correct. For example, consider the following deduction:
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00019">19</pagenum>


<h1>
	                  FOUNDATIONS OF RESEARCH, page no:19
</h1>

<p>
Major premise: All regular employees are insincere
Minor premise: Mohan is a regular employee
Conclusion: Mohan is insincere.
</p>

<p>
	The conclusion is justified only if both the premises are acceptable as true. Since the major
premise is not true, the conclusion is therefore defective, even if Mohan turns out to be insincere

Relevance of Induction and Deduction: The logical processes of both induction and deduction
 are useful in research studies. Both are “inseparable parts of a system of reasoning. In other words,
distinct processes of inductive and deductive reasoning do not exist.”29 Both processes are often used
simultaneously. There is a sequencing of induction -deduction processes, which is described by John
Dewey as the “double movement of reflective thought.”30 When a puzzling condition occurs, one
seeks inductively to explain by a hypothesis. In turn, the hypothesis is used in the deduction of further
facts, which can confirm or deny the truth of the hypothesis. For example, the chief executive of an
enterprise observes that profits are lower than expected (fact). He asks, “What is the cause”? His
tentative conclusion (hypothesis1) is “lower profits are due to fall in sales.” He examines the sales
records and finds that the actual sales volume is lower than the budgeted figure (fact). This fact
confirms hypothesis. Now he may raise a second question, “Why is sales volume low?” Recalling
that there had been some problem of competition, he infers (hypothesis2) “Competition accounts for
a fall in sales.” He will analyse the market reports received from regional offices and verify the truth
of this hypothesis. This process of fact/  question /hypothesis /deducted fact/ confirmation / question, and
so on may be continued till the final explanation is arrived at.
</p>

<h1>
 Requisites of a Good Scientific Method
</h1>

<p>
	The essentials31 of a good scientific method as summed up by the Advisory Committee on
Economic and Social Research of the Council of Social Science Research are:

1. Careful logical analysis of the problem, separating its elements and whenever possible,
   formulating hypothesis;

2. Unequivocal definition of terms and concepts and statistical units and measures, so that
   others will understand exactly and be able to repeat the analysis and test the generalizations;

3. Collection of data pertinent to the problem under study;

4. Classification of data;

5. Expression of variables in quantitative terms whenever possible;

6. Rigorous and exacting experimental or statistical procedure in summarizing the data and in
   isolating the attributes or variables and measuring their relationship and inter- effects;

7.Sound logical reasoning as to the testing of hypothesis and drawing generalizations;

8. Statement in unassailable terms of the exact conclusion arrived at from the findings;

9. Specific and clear statement of generalizations to facilitate checking and testing by others;
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00020">20</pagenum>

<h1>
	       page no :20
</h1>

<p>
10. Complete elimination of personal equation; and

11. Complete and careful reporting of the research process, definitions and the methods of
analysis so that others can check the analysis or test the generalizations with new sets of
data.
</p>

<h1>
	The Components of Scientific Approach
</h1>

<p>
	The scientific approach has two components: the procedural and the personal.
Procedural component: The procedure of scientific method involves the following major steps:
1. Deﬁne the problem.

2. Establish hypothesis as to causes/ explanations/ solutions of the problem.

3. Collect the data.

4. Analyse the data to test the hypothesis and draw inferences.
</p>

<p>
	The researcher must have a thorough knowledge of the subject matter of the problem so as to
formulate a conceptual model for its study. He must operationalise the concepts to determine the data
requirements. He must select appropriate methods for collection of data and use relevant statistical
techniques and tests for testing hypothesis. All these steps32 require creative imagination, extraordinary
care and patience.
</p>

<p>
The researcher’s personal qualities: The researcher’s qualities and attitudes are more important
than the procedural steps. The researcher needs, as rightly emphasized by Eigelbemer, “the scientific
imagination to construct hypothesis, the resourcefulness, manipulative skill and persistence to carry
through the experiment, the perspective which distinguishes the essential from the non—essential, and
the reasoning which coordinated individual facts into a principle.”33 He must possess integrity,
honesty, sincerity: poise and perseverance. He must also possess “the spirit of independence and the
spirit of originality.”34
</p>

<p>
	In short, a true scientist must possess “the devotion of a mother, the poise of a judge, the
objectivity of a philosopher the courage of a soldier, the perseverance and patience of a beaver, the
fervor of a patriot and the vision of a prophet. ”35

Scientific attitude: Above all, the scientific method calls for scientific attitude. The scientific
attitude is based on a complexity of elements, viz.,

 Consistent thinking;

 Objective, dispassionate and unbiased devotion to collection and treatment of facts;

 Overcoming personal preconceptions and value judgments, because they not only have a
distorting effect on the data but are also highly insidious;

 Avoiding, personal and vested interests— the scientist does not tailor his views to fit
preconceived notions or preferences of men in power;
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00021">21</pagenum>

 <h1>
	FOUNDATIONS OF RESEARCH,  page no:21
</h1>

  <p>
  Avoiding wishful thinking;

  Stubborn determination to analyse one’s own system of thinking and taking nothing for
  granted without evidence, tests and proofs;

 “Faith in the universality of cause and effect.”36 Without this faith, a pursuit of scientific
  knowledge may be flouted whenever it interferes with special interest or prejudices;

 Ardent curiosity, fertile imagination and love of experimental inquiry;37

 “Compassion and understanding”8 — without these knowledge could be dangerous;

 Patience and self- control and ability to overcome wishful thinking; and

 Keeping an open mind.

  All these elements are components of the scientific attitude. “These elements tend to correct not
  only factual error, but also mental, emotional and volitional frailties  of a research worker.”39

</p>

<h1>
	                    1.3 RESEARCH AND THEORY
</h1>

<p>
	Research is cloSely related to theory. Theory provides a conceptual model for research. Research,
in turn contributes to theory. What 1s theory? What are its uses to research? What does research do
for theory? These questions are discussed in this section.
</p>

<h1>
Meaning of Theory
</h1>

<p>

	In the popular usage, theory is perceived as speculative or unsubstantiated or unrealistic or
ivory- tower ideas. This is a wrong notion. A theory in science is not the result of mere speculation.
It is the gradual. outgrowth of constructive study of the accumulated sorted facts.
</p>

<p>
	Theory is more properly defined as “a set of systematically interrelated concepts, definitions,
and propositions that are advanced to explain and predict phenomena (facts).”40 Jack Gibbs defines
theory as “a set of logically interrelated statements in the form of empirical assertions about properties
of infinite classes of events or things.”41 A theory may not only explain or predict phenomena, but
also specify causal relationships among variables. In the latter sense, a theory may be defined as "
a set of systematically related propositions specifying causal relationships among variables.”42
</p>

<p>
	Strictly defined, a theory, as used in science, is a coherent “set of hypotheses”, says R . B .
Braithwaite, “ which form a deductive system that is, which is arranged in such a way that from some
of the hypotheses as premises all the other hypotheses follow.”43 Arnold Rose’s View is similar to
the above statement. He defines theory as “ an integrated body of definitions, assumptions and general
propositions covering a given subject matter from which a comprehensive and consistent set of
specific and testable (principles) can be deducted logically.”44
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00022">22</pagenum>

<h1>
	               page no :22
</h1>

<p>
A few examples may clarify the meaning of theory.

    A frustrated person, who is unable or afraid to express his aggression directly toward the
    perceived source of his frustration, may divert his aggression into another channel.

This theory explains why a frustrated manager takes it out on a subordinate instead of his boss.
 The standard of living of a family is the function of its income, size and life style.

    This theory provides a basis for studying consumer behaviour and formulating appropriate
marketing strategies.
</p>

<h1>
Criteria of Theory
</h1>

<p>
	Theories start out as ideas. It is the extent to which ideas conform to basic demands of proposition
formulation that determines whether or not they will assume the stature of theory. The criteria to be
met by the set of ideas are:

1. They must be logically consistent. There must be no internal contradictions.

2. They must be interrelated.

3. The statements must be exhaustive as to cover the full range of variations concerning the
nature of the phenomena in question.

4. The propositions should be mutually exclusive.

5. They must be capable of being tested through research.

    The set of ideas in social sciences generally fail to meet the above basic demands of theories.
They are broadly grouped into general configurations referred to as “frames of reference, ”
“perspectives” or “approaches.”
</p>

<h1>
Components of Theoretical Ideas
</h1>

 <p>
 The major components of theoretical ideas in social science include:

 1. Assumptions and ideas: They consist of untestable premises about the nature of selected
 aspects of social life.

 2. Frames of reference: They identify the major dimensions of social life that will be subjected
    to empirical scrutiny.

 3. Concepts are abstractions; e .g ., group, motivations, democracy.

 4. Variables are relational units of analysis that can assume designated sets of values, e. g., age,
    educational level, and income.

 5. Propositions are statements betWeen or among variables.

 6. Theory: The end- product of the above components is a theory.
</p>

<h1>
Theory vs. Fact
</h1>

<p>

	Theory and facts are interrelated. While a fact is an “empirically verifiable observation,”45 a
theory speciﬁes the relationships between facts or order them in a meaningful way. Facts gathered at
random like counting the grains of sand in sand pile, counting the number of vehicles plying on a

</p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page00023">23</pagenum>

<h1>
	FOUNDATIONS OF RESEARCH, page no :23
</h1>

<p>
	Road, etc., cannot produce a :body of knowledge. Only when related facts are gathered and studied,
the development of science can take place.
</p>
<p>

 Theory indicates the kinds of data to be gathered; it offers a conceptual scheme for systematizing
a phenomenon; it summaries facts into empirical generalizations; and it predicts facts.
</p>

<p>
 Facts, in turn, help to initiate theories, they lead to the reformulation of an existing theory, they
cause the rejection of theories, which do not conform, to facts; and they clarify and modify theories.46
</p>

<p>
	Theory and Fact belong to two different worlds — conceptual and empirical worlds respectively.
Can there be a bridge between the two? The researchers use some techniques to bridge the gulf
between theory and fact. One of them is conceptualization. Theory uses concepts for explaining a
phenomenon. When new facts invalidate a theory; new concepts are developed to reformulate the
theory. For example, when inflation cannot be explained in terms of the concept of demand- pull
inflation, another concept of cost- push inflation is used for the purpose.
</p>

<p>
  Another technique used for bridging theory and fact is the process of classification or typology.
Classification is an attempt to impose some sort of order on an amorphous mass of facts. It is an
attempt to trace interrelationships through the process of grouping. Scientists in various disciplines
have made effective use of classification as a tool of analysis.
</p>

<p>
	Adam smith, a classical economist, for example, classified society into different kinds of producers,
in his Wealth of nations, to show that exchange is beneficial to everybody. Karl Marx classified the
 society into ‘haves’ and ‘have nots ’ and showed that exchange benefits only the former. Colin Clarke
classified the economy into the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors in his study of the empirical
laws of economic growth. (Conditions of Economic Progress, London, Macmillan, 1951).
</p>

 <h1>
Theory vs. Hypothesis
</h1>

<p>
	A hypothesis47 is formulated before empirical evidences or facts are gathered. It deals with a
narrow range of ideas. It is a preliminary assumption adopted for the explanation of phenomenon. A
theory, on the other hand, is a generalization arrived at after verification and it deals with a broader
range of facts. It is one of the sources of hypotheses.

    The assembled facts are transformed by a researcher into constructs. The constructs are then
assembled into a provisional hypothesis. When it is tested and verified and found to be true, it is
designated as a scientific theory. When the theory is tested and accepted by scientists as correct under
the same conditions, it is regarded as a law.
</p>

<h1>
Role of Theory in Research
</h1>

<p>
	Theory serves research in many useful ways.

1. Delimitation of Study: Theory narrows the range of facts to be studied. It helps to select
a few relevant aspects of a phenomenon. Any phenomenon may be studied from different
angles. A co—operative society, for example, can be studied as an economic enterprise, or
as a social organisation or as an instrument for the promotion of the welfare of weaker
sections, or as a democratic institution or a member -unit of a federal structure. Each science/
discipline deals with a specific aspect of a phenomenon. Only then can the work of a
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00024">24</pagenum>

<h1>
	page no :24
</h1>

<p>
	discipline be reduced to manageability. Thus theory relating to a discipline delimits/ narrows
the range of  things, which come within its purview.
</p>

<p>
    2. Conceptual model: Theory provides a conceptual framework for a study. Every science/
discipline is an organized body of facts —— a structure of interrelated concepts with precise
definitions. A researcher selects a priori a few facts from the theory and develops conceptual
structure of their interrelationships — conceptual schemata —— for the proper formulation of
the selected problem.
</p>


	<p>
	3. Summarization: Another function of theory is to summarize. concisely what is already
known about the object of study. Theorizing integrates the major empirical generalizations
of an era. From time to time in any science there will be changes in the structure of
relationships between propositions. In each era, scientists move from older systems of
theory towards a more acceptable new system. For example, in the discipline of management,
by stressing social needs, the human relations movement improved on the classical approach,
which treated productivity as a mere engineering problem.

	It is through systems of propositions that many of our common statements must be
interpreted. Facts are seen as parts of a framework rather than as isolated observations. Take
a few examples: “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts”; “The management is
culture- found”; “Indian society is caste- ridden and hierarchical.” These statements are
apparently simple ones; but if we study them in depth we may find that behind each of them
is a complex series of observations, a set of assumptions and a systems of propositions.
“These are an implicit or explicit fact chain or theory which gives such ‘simple’ statements
their full meaning.”48
</p>


<p>
	4. Uniformity: Theory states a general uniformity beyond the immediate observations. A person
sitting under a mango tree may observe ripe mangoes falling on the ground. But beyond this
observation, there is the general law of gravitation.
</p>

<p>
 5. Prediction: Theoretical generalizations can be used to predict further facts. The most obvious
is the extrapolation from the known to the unknown. For example, we may observe that in
a modern civilized community there is a low birth rate. From this, we may predict that if
modern Way of life is introduced into a traditional rural or tribal community, its birth rate
would decline.
</p>

<p>
  6. Gaps in knowledge: Theory also points to areas, which have not been explored. If a theory
states that professionalisation of management contributes to enterprises success, we can see
where further facts might be sought. What are the variables of professional management?
How can we explain the success of family -managed undertakings? Such gaps in knowledge
are brought to light through the questions arising out of theory.
</p>

<h1>
Contribution of Research to Theory
</h1>

<p>
	Since the relationship between theory and research is interactional, Research in turn, contributes
to development of theory.

1. Research initiates theory: The ﬁndings of research may lead to the formulation of theories.
Scientiﬁc experiments have led to the development of various theories in physics, chemistry etc.

</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00025">25</pagenum>


<h1>
	       FOUNDATIONS OF RESEARCH, page no:25
</h1>

<p>
similarly research in social sciences have cOntributed to the development of several theories, e. g.,
organizational theories, Herzberg Theory of Motivation.
</p>

 <p>
	In the course of conducting a research, the researcher may accidentally stumble upon unanticipated,
anomalous and striking fact, which may lead to new theories. Some examples of such accidental
findings are: the penicillium fungus inhibits bacterial growth; a pendulum of given length, in free
 motion, will swing back and forth in equal time.
</p>


 <p>
	 2. Research tests an existing theory: One major function of empirical research is to test
hypotheses deduced from existing theories. If a hypothesis is not confirmed by research, the theory
from which the hypothesis is deduced, is re-examined and tested.
</p>
<p>
   3. Reformulation of an existing theory: When a theory does not ﬁt into new findings of
research, it is rejected and reformulated to encompass the new findings.

     For example, Elton Mayo’s experiments in Hawthorne plant of Western Electric from 1927 to
 1932 have led to the replacement of the old theory — ‘A person is motivated by personal economic -
needs, to a new theory — ‘A person is motivated by social needs, wanting rewarding on -the- job
relationships, and more responsive to work group pressures.’
</p>
<p>
	4. Research refocuses theory: Empirical research may give a new focus to the existing theory.
When we find that the ineffectiveness of co-operative democracy in India cannot be understood in
terms of political administration but rather in terms of socio- economic and cultural dimensions, we
explore these latter dimensions by further study. It gives a new focus to the theory of co operative
democracy.49
</p>


<p>
   5. Research clarifies theory: Concepts are drawn from theory. But research cannot proceed on
the basis of their theoretical meanings. For research purposes the concepts have to be operationalised,
i. e., defined specially with concrete empirical indicators. For example, such concepts as ‘intelligence’,
‘morale’, ‘democratic participation’, ‘operational efficiency’, small farmer’ have been clarified by
researchers by constructing indices or scales for their measurement. Such clarifications and redefinitions
lead to the discovery of new hypotheses. Then we have to sharpen our theories to test those hypotheses.


    In short, theory and research may be separate distinct operating, but they are inseparable
complementary components of scientific endeavour. To quote Blumer Herbert, “theory exercises
compelling influence on research setting problems, staking out objects and leading enquiry into
asserted relations. In turn, findings of fact test theories and in suggesting new problems invite the
formulation of new proposals. Theory, inquiry and empirical fact are interwoven in a texture of
operation with theory guiding inquiry, inquiry seeking and isolating facts and facts affecting theory.
The fruitfulness of their interplay is the means by which an empirical science develops.”50

 helping selection of variables or identification of classes of data to be collected,

 making research findings intelligible.

     One may also use the research findings to formulate new theoretical propositions or testing
existing theory. Thus, there is no fixed way of bringing theory into research process.

However, there are some general principles51 regarding the use of theory in research. There are

1. A knowledge of the existing theory in one’s area of research is essential for conducting
  research. One should become familiar with relevant theory without, of course, becoming
  lost in it.

2. Concepts are the crucial components of theory and so their clear definitions a
  operationalisations are essential to the designing of the study.

3. One should view theory as hypothetical proposition and not as conclusive fact. In this way
   one will be more alert to observations, which challenge the theory and thus be better
   prepared to revise it so as to ﬁt the empirical observations.

4. One should pay close attention to all odd and puzzling unexpected observations as they are
   source for new theoretical approaches.

    To sum up, a researcher should use theory to plan and direct his lines of study, but use empirical
observations to test and refine his theoretical propositions.

	              1.4 CONCEPTUAL OR THEORETICAL MODELS
</h1>

<h1>
Introduction
</h1>

     <p>
	The body of knowledge relating to any subject is vast. When one reviews it for the study of a
selected problem, one may get lost in it, unless one knows what is relevant and what is not relevant
How can this be determined? To aid in this difficult process, a conceptual model is developed, “Model
building is a universal method of scientific research, in the same way that quantifying knowledge‘
a self- evident aim of research.”52
</p>

<h1>
Definition of Model
</h1>

<p>
	Conceptual or theoretical model is a simplified systematic conceptual structure of interrelated
elements in some schematic form53 such as narrative statement or mathematical equation. 1t described
relationships between and among concepts and variables.

A model possesses ﬁve different characteristics: namely, level of analysis, boundaries, specificity
construct relationship statement, and assumptions.
</p>

<h1>
Process of Model Building
</h1>
<p>
The process of model building involves several steps, viz.,
   1. identify the phenomenon to be represented by a model;
   2. determine the nature and purpose of analysis for which the model is constructed;
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00027">27</pagenum>


<h1>
	           FOUNDATIONS OF RESEARCH, page no:27
</h1>

<p>
3. gain a thorough understanding of the phenomenon through observation or survey of available
   literature relating to it;

4. conceptualize its meaning and nature;

5. identity the important variables and attributes;

6. examine the nature of inter-relationships among them;

7. formulate the structure of the inter-relatiOnships; and

8. present the structure in the form of a precise statement or mathematical equation, defining
   the concepts, stating the assumptions and using the rules of logic.

Thus, model building calls for high levels of logical skill and mathematical competence.
</p>

<h1>
Conditions
</h1>

<p>

  A model must satisfy certain conditions.

  First, a model should be (a) explicit in terms of construct definition and critical relationship
among them, (b) clear about the operationalization of each construct and (c) empirically testable.54

  Second, there must be one- to -one correspondence between the elements of the phenomenon
under study and the elements of the model representing it.

  Third, the model must preserve the important relationships noticed in the phenomenon.

  Fourth, the causative factors in the model must be well defined, for example, can we be able
to explain inflation as resulting from an increase in the quantity of money without causal connection?
The Keynesian theory gave the causal connection between inflation and investment and thus provided
a rational base for explaining inflation.

  Lastly, the model must satisfy the principle of internal consistency. One cannot assume that
production equipment undergoes technical progress and still remains the same as was done in the neo
-classical analysis of growth.
</p>

<h1>
Typology of Models
</h1>

<p>
   Models may be broadly classified into (a) abstract models and (b) real models.

   Abstract models represent high- level abstraction for making a simplified conceptual framework.
They are divorced from application to real problems. Real models, on the other hand, represent a
blueprint of real problems and are applicable to given situations.

    The real models may be classified into (a) Heuristic model and (b) Extensor model. The former
makes an exploratory suggestion and the latter extends it into detailed form nearer to reality, amplifying
it.

     Models, which depict the causal relationships between the variables, may be described as causal
models.
</p>

<h1>
Choice of Models
</h1>

<p>
	There are some principles or guidelines governing the selection of models relevant to the
problems under study.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00028">28</pagenum>


<h1>
	18          METHODOLOGY OF RESEARCH IN SOCIAL SCIENCES, page no:28
</h1>

<p>
	The first principle is to choose initially a simple model, i. e., Heuristic one in order to explore
the area of analysis under simplified assumptions. The socio-economic situations are extremely complex
in the real world. Therefore, it is desirable to select a few important variables and make simplified
assumptions and then build up the model, covering those important variables only, because the
analysis is likely to be complicated even with a few variables.
</p>

<p>
	The second principle is to have an in built procedure for enhancing the scope so as to take it
and enlarging the model for coming closer to the reality. Then the model becomes Extensory one, as
it extends the scope of the initial model. If the simplified assumptions cannot be removed without
breaking down the whole model, then the original model must be discarded and a new model developed.
</p>

<p>
	The most obvious example is the use of the Cobb Douglas Function55 in Production Economics.
It relates output in manufacturing industries to labour and capital inputs, and it is expressed as
P = bLaCl-al where P: total output; L = Index of labour input C: Index of fixed capital; the exponents
'a’ and “1-a’ are the elasticity of production, i.e., the percentage response of output to percentage
changes in labour and capital respectively.
</p>

<p>
	This model 18 based on the assumptions of malleability of capital and constancy of the share of
wages in income. These assumptions are highly restrictive for analyzing production. When these are
removed, the whole system breaks down.
</p>

<p>
	Illustration: In order to illustrate research models, a model developed by Subrata Pandey56 is
given below.

  The organizational effectiveness in a R &amp; D organization is determined by five sets of variables,
viz., macroclimate (organizational climate), microclimate (job climate), personality of scientists, and
their attitudinal and performance variables.

  The organizational effectiveness is indicated by the scientists’ rated performances. The
interrelationships between and among the determinant variables are depicted in a schematic diagram.
(See Exh. 1.1). All the variables were operationalized and measured by appropriate measuring tools.
</p>

<h1>
Advantages
</h1>

<p>
Models may be of great help in research.

	A model is a guiding tool for the entire process of research from the conceptualization to
analysis through the testing of hypotheses.

    A model enables the researcher to identify and concentrate, on important and relevant variables
and attributes, instead of getting lost in irrelevant and unimportant details.

    A model helps considerably in ensuring that the reasoning is sound, as the model builder has
to define his concepts, state his premises and use the rules of logic in his exercise.

    A model represents pictures of theories. As such, it enables the researcher to grasp more quickly,
and comprehensively the sorts of relations among variables postulated by theories.

    A model enables us to comprehend precisely the direction of the relations among variables
Whether a given factor has positive or negative impact on another can be readily ascertained.
</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00029">29</pagenum>


<h1>
                       FOUNDATIONS OF RESEARCH, page no:29
</h1>

 <p>
	 A model shows more clearly the boundaries or conceptual limits of theories. It tells us where
a theory ends. We can concentrate on the phenomena to which it is applicable.

     A model reminds us the need for abstraction in any systematic investigation.

     In social sciences it is impossible to conduct strictly controlled experiments. A series of models
can serve as a reasonable substitute for controlled experiments by acting as a mental laboratory for
identifying new relationships and clarifying thought.

     A model suggests the techniques of analysis, ways to interpretation of data and ways to draw
 conclusions.57
</p>

<h1>
Limitations of Models
</h1>

<p>
	Models are not unmixed blessings. They have some drawbacks and limitations.

    A model building calls for high levels of logical skills and mathematical competence, persons
who do not have these skills, cannot build useful models.
</p>

<p>
	There is also the opposite danger. Those who have expertise in constructing models may go too
far. They may be tempted to create abstract models unrelated to any real understanding of problems.
Rigour is necessary for any analysis, but rigour is no substitute for relevance.
</p>

<p>
	Another danger 1n the indiscriminate use of models is that abstract models have a tendency to
pose themselves as reality. Models, which are analytical tools, then tend to become objects of worship.
</p>

<p>
	Another problem associated with the use of model is that model builders who are usually
craftsmen, and not theorists take too much for granted regarding meanings of concepts, which they
use. “Concepts are intrinsically relational; they are not like the bricks that anyone can use in any
construction.”58 Concepts used in each model must be defined afresh in terms of the relationships of
that model. “To construct models in the air, out of uncritically conceived concepts that are inadequate
to reality and not logically consistent” ...... as rightly stressed by Gunnar Myrdal, “does not represent
scientific progress, it come nearer to being an intellectual fraud.”59
</p>

 <p>  Models may suffer from the problem of inadequacy of the functional forms of mathematics. In
mathematical analysis, there are two basic functional forms: additive and multiplicative. There are
situations in which either one is appropriate. For example, neither the exiStence of a strong union nor
that of good profit would by itself be sufficient to explain wage increase obtained by workers.

   Models constitute rather severe simplifications. In social sciences for example, there is a tendency
to present extremes or polar ends as dichotomies, e. g., good/ bad; objective/ subjective; formal/ informal.
Variables like these are, in fact, no discrete entities but continuous dimensions.

  Models narrow the full implications of theories so much that fruitful avenues of exploration not
portrayed explicitly may be ignored.

  Models tend to convey the impression that all the logically consistent dimensions have been
included. This, however, is not always the case.

Therefore, one should not rely on models mechanically, one should keep in mind the limitations
of models.

<h1>
 	                        2.1 SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
</h1>


<h1>
Social Sciences
</h1>

<p>
	Sciences are broadly divided into natural (or physical) sciences and social sciences. Social
sciences include various disciplines dealing with human life, human behaviour, social groups and
social institutions. They consist Of Anthropology, Behaviour Science, Commerce, Demography
Economics, Education, Geography, History, Law, Linguistics, Management, Political Science
Psychology, Public Administration, Sociology and Social Work. Though these sciences are treated
separate branches of knowledge for the purpose of study, they are interdependent studies of the
different aspects of the same object, viz., man. By applying scientific method of study, the social
sciences have grown and advanced man’s knowledge of himself.
</p>

<p>
	Social sciences are not exact science like physical sciences, as they, unlike the latter, deal with
human beings. Human nature and man’s environment are so complex that it is more difficult to
comprehend and predict human behaviour than the physical phenomena. No two persons are alike is
feelings, drives or emotions. No one is consistent form. one moment to another. The behaviour of
human beings is influenced by  biological, psychological, socio- cultural temporal and environmental
factors. It is difficult to see the underlying uniformities in the diversity of complex human behaviour
A controlled experiment, which is sine qua non of an empirical science, in general well nigh impossible
in social sciences.
</p>

<h1>
Social Science Research
</h1>

<p>
	Social science research is a systematic method of exploring, analyzing and conceptualizing
human life in order to extend, correct or verify knowledge of human behaviour and social life. In
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00033">33</pagenum>


<h1>
	           SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH, page no:33
</h1>

<p>
other Words, Social science research “seek to find explanations to unexplained social phenomena, to
clarify the doubtful, and correct the misconceived facts of social life.”1
</p>

<h1>
Objectives of Social Science Research
</h1>

 <p>
   The aim of social science research, like research in physical sciences, is to discover new facts
or verify and test old facts. -

   It tries to understand the human behaviour and its interaction with the environment and the
social institutions. ,
   It tries to find out the causal connection between human activities and natural laws governing
them.

   Another purpose of social science research is to develop new scientific tools, concepts and
theories, which would facilitate reliable and valid study of human behaviour and social life.
</p>

<h1>
Functions or Uses of Social Science Research
</h1>
<p>
	The functions of Social Science Research are varied. They are:

   1. Discovery of Facts and their Interpretation: Research provides answer to questions of
what, where, when, how and why of man, social life and institutions. They are half- truths,
pseudo- truths and superstitions. Discovery of facts and their interpretation help us discard
such distortions and thus enlighten us and contribute to our understanding of social reality.
Research strengthens our desire for truth and opens up before our eyes, hidden social
mysteries.
</p>

<p>
   2. Diagnosis of Problems and their Analysis: The developing countries have innumerable
problems such as poverty, unemployment, economic imbalance, economic inequality, social
tension, low productivity, technological backwardness, etc. The nature and dimensions of
such problems have to be diagnosed and analysed; social science research plays a significant
role in this respect. An analysis of problems leads to an identification of appropriate remedial
actions.
</p>

<p>
   3. Systematization of Knowledge: The facts discovered through research are systematized and
the body of knowledge is developed. Thus, research contributes to the growth of various
social sciences and theory building.

</p>

<p>
	4. Control over Social Phenomena: Research in social science areas equips us with first- hand
knowledge about the organizing and working of the society and its institutions. This
knowledge gives us a greater power of control over the social phenomena.
</p>

<p>
	5. Prediction: Research aims at finding an order among social facts and their causal relation.
This affords a sound basis for prediction in several cases. Although the predictions cannot
be perfect because of the inherent limitations of social sciences, they will be fairly useful
for better social planning and control.
</p>

<p>
	6. Development Planning: Planning for socio-economic development calls for baseline data
on the various aspects of our society and economy, resource endowment, peoples needs and
aspirations, etc., Systematic Research can give us the required data base for planning and
designing developmental schemes and programmes. Analytical studies can illuminate critical
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00034">34</pagenum>


<h1>
	  page no :34
</h1>

<p>
	areas of policy and testing the validity of planning assumptions. Evaluation studies point out
    the impact of plan, policies and programmes and throw out suggestions for their proper
    reformulation.
</p>

<p>
	7. Social Welfare: Social research can unfold and identify the causes of social evils and
problems. It can thus help in taking appropriate remedial actions. It can also give us sound
guidelines for appropriate positive measures of reform and social welfare.
</p>

<h1>
Scope of Social Science Research
</h1>

<p>
	The fields of social science research are virtually unlimited, and the materials of research
endless. Every group of social phenomena, every phase of human life, and every stage of past and
present development are materials for the social scientists.2 The areas of research in various social
sciences listed in the Annexure would give an idea of the vast scope for research in social sciences.
</p>

<h1>
Inter-disciplinary Approach
</h1>

<p>
	Social Science research calls for inter-disciplinary approach, for human life cannot be
compartmentalized into psychological, social, economic or political aspects. “Man lives in a socio
-economic and political world and thrives on its varied relationships. It is inconceivable that the study
of bare and isolated events on any one aspect of man’s life would yield any meaningful results.”3 A
discipline- speciﬁfic study of a social problem from an angle of, say economics or sociology or political
science only cannot give a correct and total view of the problem. As Gunnar Myrdal points out, “ In
reality there are no economic, sociological or psychological problems, but simply problems, and they
are complex.”4 Myrdal’ s most enduring contribution of “circular cumulative causation” stresses that
no social science by itself is sufficiently self- contained to deal with any social problem. It is affected
cumulatively by economic, sociological, psychological, legal, historical forces and factors. For example,
the problem of poverty cannot be just studied as a mere economic problem or a social problem or a
political issue. The approaches and theories of all these disciplines must be blended to provide a
meaningful and valid approach to the problem. This inter-disciplinary approach facilitates better
underStanding of the complex level of social- psychological- economic— political forces, intricately,
interwoven in modern life.
</p>

<h1>
	2.2 OBJECTIVITY
</h1>

<h1>
	Meaning
</h1>


<p>
	Objectivity is sine qua non of the scientific method. It means the willingness and ability to
examine evidence dispassionately. It is the first condition of research. Objectivity means basing
conclusion on facts without any bias and value judgement. The conclusion should be independent of
one’s personal beliefs, likes, dislikes and hopes. Both the data and the inference drawn from their
analysis must be free from bias and prejudices.
</p>

<p>
	Research, as stressed by Myrdal, has an inbuilt, self- cleaning, or self- healing capacity. Facts
kick, and do so even- though with some delay when data are first assembled under categories that
correspond to the biased approach applied but are inadequate to reality.5
</p>










<pagenum page="normal" id="page00035">35</pagenum>

<h1>
Factors Affecting Objectivity, page no :35
</h1>

<p>
	It is very difficult to achieve objectivity in social science research. This difficulty arises out of
the adverse influences of (1) personal prejudices and bias, (2) value judgement, (3) ethical dilemma
and (4) complexity of social phenomena.
</p>

 <p>
	Personal prejudices and biases emanate from habits of thought, temperamental weaknesses,
skeptical attitude, wishful thinking, vested interest etc. “ Prejudice and biases are like fantasies- to
believe what is comforting to believe.”6 These make on to believe something without considering
evidence.
</p>

<p>
   Value related problem arises from the social context within which research occurs. A researcher’s
attitudes towards socio-economic issues are influenced by his values. His judgement is coloured by
the ‘ism’— capitalism or communism or socialism, etc., to which he belongs and the writer /philosopher
who inspired him. Even great social scientists project their values and views in their theories. The
proletarian interpretation of Karl Marx, Bertrand Russel’ s power interpretation of social order, Freud’ s
sex interpretation of society, Fabian socialism of George Bernard Shaw and Gandhiji’s philosophy of
limiting wants and trusteeship are illustrations. To quote Gunnar Myrdal, “value premises are needed
even in the theoretical stage of establishing knowledge about facts and factual relations. A view is
impossible except from a vieWpoint. A disinterested social science has never existed and can never
come to exist —— for logical reasons, valuations are always implied in our search for truth.”7
</p>

<p>
	 Personal preconceptions may not only have a distorting effect on the data but are also highly
insidious, because they are so “ subtle, so implicit, so deeply noted that it is difficult for us to discern
them in ourselves, or when they are called to our attention, to avoid rationalizing them, instead of
examining them objectively.”8
</p>

<p>
	Ethical dilemmas arises out of the researcher’s relations with other participants in the research
process. There are four types of interpersonal relations that pose potential ethical dilemmas:
(l) relations with those sponsoring the research, (2) relations with those permitting access to sources
of data, (3) relations with the investigators connected with the project, and (4) relations with research
subjects themselves (See Section 2.4, below).
</p>

<p>
	Social phenomena are too complex for easy comprehension, and too vast to provide precise
verifiable knowledge. A physical scientist is conﬁned to the four walls of a laboratory, and he can
conduct controlled experimentation. On the other hand, laboratory of social scientists is as vast as the
entire society and it is not amenable for controllers’ experimentation.

Although strict objectivity is next to impossibility, it is possible for a reflective researcher of
social life to attain a reasonable level of objectivity consistent with logical and systematic thinking.
</p>

<h1>
Achieving Reasonable Objectivity in Social Science Research
</h1>

<p>
The following approaches and measures may contribute to some degree of objectivity.

 1. Patience and Self- control: A researcher must have utmost patience and self- control. He
 should not be overwhelmed by personal likes -and undisciplined imagination and wishful
 thinking. He must discipline himself to avoid prejudging the phenomenon under study.
</p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page00036">36</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:36
</h1>

<p>
2. Open mind: A researcher often succumbs to the habit of thinking and personal notions that
leads him to presuppose that certain facts are “truths.” He must have an open mind to
subject his research process and interpretations to the critical review of other scientists.
Only by such interaction, can corrections be made.

3. Use of standardized concepts: The concepts should be precisely defined and used consistently
so as to avoid misconceptions and confusion.

4. Use of quantitative method: Appropriate statistical and mathematical techniques of analysis
may be used, as they are free from subjective bias.

5. Co-operative research: Group research will be more objective than an individual research.
Group interaction will reduce the influence of personal bias.

6. Use of random sampling: In drawing a sample of units of study, random sampling technique
may be used, as it is free from personal prejudices.
</p>

<h1>
	                   2.3 LIMITATIONS OF SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
</h1>

<p>
	Research in social sciences has certain limitations and problems when compared with research
in physical sciences. They are discussed below:
</p>

<h1>
Scientist — A Part of What is Studied
</h1>

<p>
	The fact that social scientist is part of the human society which he studies gives rise to certain limitations.

    Man must have to be his own guinea pig, as pointed out by Julian Huxley. This has a number
of methodological consequences. For example, it restricts the scope for controlled experiments. It
limits the scope for objectivity in social science research, as explained earlier. (See Section 2.2
above).
</p>

<h1>
Complexity of the Subject Matter
</h1>

<p>
	The subject matter of research in social science, viz., human society and human behaviour is
too complex, varied and changing to yield to the scientific categorization, measurement, analysis and
prediction. The multiplicity and complexity of causation make it difficult to apply the technique of
experimentation.

    Human behaviour can be studied only by other human beings, and this always distorts
fundamentally the facts being studied so that there can be no objective procedure for achieving the
truth.9
</p>

<h1>
    Human Problems
</h1>

<p>
	A social scientist faces certain human problems,» which the natural scientist is spared.10 These
problems are varied and include refusal of respondents, improper understanding of questions by them,
their loss of memory, their reluctance to furnish certain information, etc. All these problems cause
biases and invalidate the research findings and conclusions.
</p>










<pagenum page="normal" id="page00037">37</pagenum>


<h1>
personal Values, page no:37
</h1>

<p>
	Subjects and clients, as well as investigators, have personal values, which are apt to become
involved in the research process. 11 One should not assume that these are freely exploitable. The
investigator must have respect for the client’s values.
</p>

<h1>
Anthropomorphization
</h1>

<p>
	 Another hazard of social science research is the danger of “the temptation to anthropomorphize
out humans. ”12 It results in using observations obtained by sheer intuition or empathy in
conceptualizing in anthropomorphic manner.
</p>

<h1>
Wrong- Decisions
</h1>

<p>
	 The quality of research findings depends upon the soundness of decisions made by the social
scientist on such crucial stages of his research process as definition of the unit of study,
operationalization of concepts, selection of sampling techniques and statistical techniques. Any mistake
in any of these decisions will vitiate the validity of his findings.
</p>

 <h1>
	               2.4 ETHICS IN SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH
</h1>

<h1>
Introduction
</h1>

    <p>
	Research in social science often involves use of unethical practices. Issues of ethics arise
primarily out of researcher’s relations with (a) sponsors of research, (b) those who permit access to
Sources of data, and (c) research participants /respondents.
</p>

<h1>
	Ethical Issues Research Sponsorship
</h1>

<p>
	Research may be funded by either research promotional bodies like research foundation, Indian
Council of Social Science Research and similar Councils and University Grants Commission or
research- users like Planning Commission, Government Departments and business undertakings and
financial institutions. In the former case, the funding takes the form of research grant and the researcher
himself takes initiative. He forwards his research proposal to the promotional body for research grant.
The granting agency does not prohibit the publication of the results for consumption by the scientific
 community.
</p>

<p>
	A contracted research undertaken for a sponsoring user organization speciﬁes the nature of the
work to be done, the time period for its completion and the conditions relating to the use of results.
Given the highly structured and restricted nature of contract research and the explicitly stated intention
of the sponsor, the primary ethical questions posed are: whether the researcher wants to operate within
the confines of such restrictions and whether he is willing to accept the restrictions regarding the
publication of the research findings. The researcher must decide these issues before accepting the
assignment.
</p>

<h1>
Approval of Access to Data
</h1>

<p>
	A social science research may require collection of data from the document and records of an
institution or from its employees. The permission from the head of the institution has to be sought.
The ethical issues that arise in this context are:

  Should the nature of the research project and its objective be indicated to the permission
granting authority?
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00038">38</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 page no :38
</h1>

<p>
   What should be the degree of anonymity to be accorded to. the institution concerned?

   Should the procedure for handling data in ways assuring the degree of anonymity guaranteed
   be stated?

   Should the findings of the study be made available to the institution concerned? If so, in
   what form they should be made available?

   There is no hard and fast rule for deciding these questions. They have to be settled mutually
by the researcher and the head of the institution concerned.
</p>

<h1>
Ethical Issues Relating to the Respondents /Subjects
</h1>

  <p>
	Of all the ethical issues, the issues concerned with the respondents are far more important. The
respondents constitute the research subjects. They are individuals from whom data are obtained. The major categories of ethical issues relating to the research subjects are:
</p>

<p>
  1. Sometimes people are made to participate in a research project without their knowledge or
consent. For example, in social- anthropological studies of rural or tribal communities, the
researcher may conduct his research without the knowledge of the people concerned, fearing
that their awareness of the research may affect the naturalness of their responses or behaviour.
The researcher who involves the research subject in research thus infringes upon their right
to make their own decision to participate or not to participate.
   Ideally speaking, the research subjects’ consent should be obtained after giving them enough
information about the proposed research. But often, the consent may be wholly or partially
forced. For instance, the employer may direct his employees to ‘cooperate’ with a research
project, or strong incentives may be offered to tempt the participants to give consent. Such
coercions restrict the research subjects’ freedom to decide whether or not to participate in
a research.

2. In some researches, the consent of respondents is obtained without informing them of the
purpose of the research. Such concealment naturally curtails the free choice of the respondents.

3. In some researches, the researcher may find it necessary to give incorrect information about
the proposed research to potential subjects in order to manipulate their perceptions and
behaviour. Such deceptions are regarded as questionable practices.

4. In studies relating to human values, the social scientists may create opportunities for research subjects to lie, steal or cheat. Is it appropriate to expose research subjects to such moral
hazards? Opinions differ.

5. Another questionable/ non- ethical practice is to expose participants to physical or mental
stress with a view to studying their reactions. For example, in a mock- hijacking of an
aircraft or a mock- panic situation in a crowd without a fore- waring, people are subject to
physical or mental stress.

6. A behavioural scientist may dig out information from respondents on private or personal
matters such as marital life or religious faith or personal opinions by employing techniques
of participant observation, indepth interviews or disguised projective test. Such practices
amount to invasion of privacy.

<p>
  7. Finally, there is the ethical issue relating to the obligation of maintaining the anonymity of
the research respondents and keeping research data in confidence. Anonymity might be
violated through reports and publications. Despite the practice of using pseudonyms, the
identity of the community or institutions becomes known indirectly.
</p>

 <p>
   Although a respondent’s name remains anonymous, his data contribute to the averages /percentages
reported for the group to which he belongs. Should the respondents be told before hand of the uses
to which their data will be put?
</p>

<h1>
Ethical Dilemmas or Benefits of Research
</h1>

<p>
   The above categories of ethical difficulties arise in social science research. The crucial question
that arises is: “Should a social scientist adopt some unethical practices out of necessity or abandon
his proposed research? It is not easy to decide this question. One of the alternatives -- ethics or
research —— has to be sacrificed. However, in the larger interest of developing useful knowledge, it
is desirable to strike a balance between the moral cost of unethical practices and the potential benefits
of research. No doubt that researchers have an obligation to the research subjects. But they have a
greater social responsibility to find facts relevant to the solution of pressing human problems and thus
to promote social welfare. An evaluation of such potential benefits of research and the moral cost, of
unethical practices will provide the clue to the choice. When the benefits far exceed the moral cost,
it is desirable to go ahead with the research, even it calls for some unethical practice like concealing
facts, invasion of privacy of respondents, etc. however, participants should not be exposed to physical
or mental stress. Professional association must devise codes of ethics to be followed while obtaining
information from individuals.

	TYPES AND METHODS OF
     RESEARCH, page no:41

<h1>
	 3.1 CLASSIFICATION OF RESEARCH
</h1>

<h1>
Introduction
</h1>

<p>
	Although any typology of research is inevitably arbitrary, Research may be Classified crudely
according to its major intent or the methods. According to the intent, research may be classified as

                        Pure Research

                        Applied Research

                        Exploratory Research

                        Descriptive Study

                        Diagnostic Study

                        Evaluation Studies

                        Action Research

According to the methods of study, research may be classified as:

                       Experimental Research

                       Analytical Study

                       Historical Research

                       Survey
</p>

<h1>
The Nature of Classification
</h1>

 <p>
	The above classification is not a watertight demarcation. It is just an approach to differentiate
the distinctive approaches to research for the purpose of better understanding. The different types of
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00042">42</pagenum>

<h1>
	page no:42
</h1>

<p>
	research are, of course, not sharply distinguishable from one another. There may be overlapping
between one type/ method and another. For example, pure research may involve experimentation or
case study or analytical study; Evaluation studies may apply experimental or survey methods;
Experimental Research is necessarily an analytical study; Survey Research may involve quasi-
experimental approach or analytical approach, and so on.

    In the following sections, the meaning, nature and the other aspects of each of the above type;
and methods of research are discussed.
</p>

<h1>
	Choice of Type/ Method of Research
</h1>

<p>
	The quality of a research project depends, among the other things, upon the suitability of
method selected for it. Hence care should be taken in selecting the appropriate method of research
for any project. A through knowledge of types and methods of research is essential for this purpose.
</p>

<h1>
	                     3.2 PURE AND APPLIED RESEARCH
</h1>

<h1>
Pure Research
</h1>

<p>
	Pure research is undertaken for the sake. of knowledge without any intention to apply it in
practice, e. g., Einstein’s theory of relativity, Newton’s contributions, Galileo’ s contribution etc.

   Pure research is also known as basic or fundamental research. It is undertaken out of intellectual
curiosity or inquisitiveness. It is not necessarily problem— oriented. It aims at extension of knowledge.
It may lead to either discovery of a new theory or refinement of an existing theory. The development
of various sciences owes much to pure research. The findings of pure research enrich the storehouse
of knowledge that can be drawn upon in the future to formulate significant practical researches. In
the words of Dixey, “natural knowledge pursued for its own sake without any direct view to future
utility will often lead to results of most unexpected kind and of very highest practical importance.”1
Thus, pure research lays the foundation for applied research. The findings of pure research formed
the basis for innumerable scientific and technological inventions like steam engine, machines.
automobiles, electronic gadgets, electronic data processing, telecommunication, etc.,' which have
revolutionized and enriched our human life.
</p>

<h1>
Applied Research
</h1>

<p>
	Applied research is carried on to find solution to a real- life problem requiring an action or policy
decision. It is thus problem- oriented and action- directed. It seeks an immediate and practical result,
e. g., marketing research carried on for developing a new market or for studying the post- purchase
experience of customers.

There is vast scope for applied research in the fields of technology, management, commerce,
economics and other social sciences. Innumerable problems are faced in these areas. They need
empirical study for finding solutions.

Though the immediate purpose of an applied research is to find solutions to a practical problem,
it may incidentally contribute to the development of theoretical knowledge by leading to the discovery
of new facts or testing of a theory or to conceptual clarity.

 <h1>
	                 TYPES AND METHODS OF RESEARCH, page no:43
</h1>

<h1>
The  interplay between Pure and Applied Research
</h1>

  <p>
	The distinction between pure and applied research is not absolute, but at best only relative, for
research may have significant potential for its application to the solution of a practical problem
now or later (e. g., application of Newton’s Law of Gravity in space research); and applied research
may end up making a scientific contribution to the development of the theoretical knowledge (e. g. .,
Elton Mayo’  Hawthorne Study’ contribution to Behavioural science).

    The terms, "pure and ‘applied’ just represent the polar ends of a continuum. “Research studies
differing degrees of ‘purity’ and ‘applicability’ , depending on whether their purpose is solely to
advance knowledge in a field or to solve some functional problem. ”2

   Goode and Hatt have highlighted the mutual contribution between pure and applied research.3
</p>

<h1>
Contribution of Pure Research
</h1>

<p>
1. By developing principle, pure research offers solutions to many practical problems. For
example, Maslow’s theory of motivation serves as a guideline for formulating incentive
schemes and approaches to motivating employees in organizations. Generalizations have
many practical applications. In fact, nothing is so practical for the goals of diagnosis or
treatment as good theoretical research.

2. Pure research helps to find the critical factors in a practical problem. For example, a
common-sense approach to prOblems like communal disharmony or ethnic conflict fail to
abstract the key factors. On the other hand, by deeper study such social maladies can be
better understood and it may be possible to find a solution to such problems.

3. Pure research develops many alternative solutions and thus enables us to choose the best
solution. By applying scientific knowledge developed by pure researches, various appliances
like radio, television, refrigerator, computer etc. have been invented. Continuous basic
research in these fields has contributed to the manufacture of more effective and useful
models at the least cost.
</p>

<h1>
Contribution of Applied Research
</h1>

<p>
1. Applied research can contribute new facts. A practical study designed to improve productivity
in agricultural farms may stimulate theoretical analysis of extension technology, land tenure
system, price parity between agricultural inputs and outputs, etc. Applied research uncovers
new facts, which enrich the concerned body of knowledge.

2. Applied research can put theory to the test. Applied research is also a scientific endeavour.
The researcher has to design it scientifically. From his knowledge of theory, he has to
develop a conceptual framework for his study and formulate hypothesis. Thus, his study
offers an Opportunity to test the validity of existing theory.

3. Applied research may aid in conceptual clarification. Many concepts like ‘small farmer’,
‘agricultural labourer’, ‘social responsibility’, ‘social structure’.., etc. are not precise. Different
people define them differently leading to confusion and lack of clarity. The vagueness of
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00044">44</pagenum>

<h1>
	page no:44
</h1>

<p>
a concept surfaces most sharply when we attempt to operationalize it for dealing with it is research. Thus, research aids conceptual clarity.
</p>

<p>
4. Applied research may integrate previously existing theories. A practical problem has many
facts. It cannot be solved by the application of abstract principles from a single science
Township development, for example, may draw upon such disciplines as town planning
geology, demography, sociology, economics, etc. Thus, the- solutiOn of a practical problem
may require some integration of the theories and principles of various disciplines.
</p>

<h1>
	                  3.3 EXPLORATORY OR FORMULATIVE RESEARCH
</h1>

<h1>
Meaning
</h1>

<p>
	Exploratory research is preliminary study of an unfamiliar problem about which the researcher
has little or no knowledge. It is similar to a doctor’s initial investigation of a patient suffering from
an unfamiliar malady for getting some clues for identifying it. “It is ill- structured and much less
focused on pre-determined objectives. ”4 It usually takes the form of a pilot study.5

  Though it is a separate type of research, it is appropriate to consider it as the first stage of.
three -stage process of exploration, description and experimentation.
</p>

<h1>
Purposes
</h1>

<p>
The purpose of an exploratory study may be:

 > to generate new ideas or

 > to increase the researcher’s familiarity with the problem or

 > to make a precise formulation of the problem or

 > to gather information for clarifying concepts or

 > to determine whether it is feasible to attempt the study.
</p>

 <p>
	Sometimes, a scientist may find, after spending a tremendous amount of energy and time on a
research project, that it is not possible to secure the required data. A preliminary exploration could
help avoiding such dismay. For example, a research student of the author wanted to study the pattern
of marketing strategies of large manufacturing enterprises. A critical pre-requisite to this study was
to know whether marketing executives would divulge adequate information about their marketing
strategies. An exploration determined that they would not.
</p>

<p>
	An exploratory study does not aim at testing hypothesis. According to Daniel Katz, it just
attempts “to see what is there rather than to predict the relationships that will be founded.”6 But it
should be so designed as to provide as definite information as possible for a set of research objectives
</p>

<h1>
	Levels of Exploratory Studies
</h1>

<p>
	Katz conceptualizes two levels of exploratory studies. “At the first level is the discovery of the
significant variables in the situation; at the second, the discovery of relationship between variables."
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00045">45</pagenum>

  <h1>
	page no:45
</h1>

<p>
It is necessary to delimit the area to be studied even at the first level. Katz warns that it is a mistake
to believe that one study is going to be able to account for all the variance in complex social phenomena He advises that‘ ‘it is much more effective to take one central set of variables and
investigate them as thoroughly as possible than to try to study the universe in one piece of research.”8
</p>

<h1>
The Need for Exploratory Studies
</h1>

<p>
	Social sciences are relatively young. Researches in them are scarce. Many of them inevitably
have to be exploratory ones. Few well- trodden paths exist to follow for the investigators of social life.
most existing theories in social sciences are either too general or too specific to provide clear
guidance for empirical research. Hence, exploratory research is necessary to get initial insight into the
problems for the purpose of formulating them for more precise investigation. Hence, it is also known
as formulative research.
</p>

<h1>
The Steps in Exploration
</h1>

<p>
 Selltiz and others9 have suggested the following three steps/ methods for the exploratory study:
 (a) A review of pertinent literature

 (b) An experience survey

 (c) An analysis of ‘insight stimulating’ cases.
</p>

<p>
	Literature survey: A study of related and pertinent books, articles and reports turns up a
number of leads and clues for further investigation that will advance the research. A workable
hypothesis may be formulated, important variables may be identified.
</p>

<p>
   Experience survey: Informal interviews with persons experience in the area of study will help
the researcher in securing insight into the subject and its various facts. In selecting the person for this
survey, representation to different facts of experience should be given. For example, in an exploratory
study of the problem of rural development, it is profitable to interview researchers familiar with rural
studies, rural development administrators, social workers, rural financial institutions and village leaders.

  The researcher should prepare an interview guide so as to have an idea of issues and aspects
of the problem on which questions may be posed. Of course, this interview guide should be flexible
enough to explore various avenues that emerge during the interviews.

This survey may yield a new hypothesis and information on the various dimensions of the study,
facilities and cooperation available for the study, and the factors to be controlled.
</p>

<p>
	Analysis of insight- stimulating cases: In an unexplored area of study, an intensive study of
some selected cases can yield stimulating insight. For example, the extraordinary theoretical insights
of Sigmund Freud on human psyche were the result of his intensive study of patients. Profound
insights into the relationship between the individual and society have been brought out by
anthropological case studies of primitive cultures.

 The types of people10 who provide ‘insight- stimulating’ information could include the following:
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00046">46</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:46
</h1>

<p>
1. New comers to the scene.

2. Marginal or peripheral individuals who are placed on the margin between contending groups.
   For example, in an organizational hierarchy, foremen are neither managers nor workers but
   something in between.

3. Individuals in transition, e. g., recently promoted or transferred employees.

4. Deviants and isolates in a group who hold a different view from the majority.

5. ‘Pure’ cases or cases that should be extreme examples of the conditions under study, e.g.,
    the most dissatisfied beneficiary of a rural development scheme.

6. Those who ﬁt well and those who do not.

7. Those who represent different categories in the system.

    The end of an exploratory study comes when the researcher finds that further research is not
presently possible on the problem or succeeds in identifying the major dimensions of the problem. In
the latter case, he has to plan the formal research design.
</p>

<h1>
	                   3.4 DESCRIPTIVE RESEARCH
</h1>

<h1>
Meaning
</h1>

<p>
	Descriptive study is a fact -finding investigation with adequate interpretation. It is the simples
type of research. It is more specific than an exploratory study, as it has focus on particular aspects
or dimensions of the problem studied. It is designed to gather descriptive information and provides
information for formulating more sophisticated studies. Data are collected by using one or more
appropriate methods: observation, interviewing and mail questionnaire.
</p>

<h1>
Criteria
</h1>

<p>
	All problems do not lend themselves to descriptive study. This method is applicable to problems
which satisfy certain criteria. First, the problem must be describable and not arguable. For instance
philosophical and controversial issues are not suitable for descriptive study. Second, the data should
be amenable to an accurate, objective, and, if possible, quantitative assemblage for reliability and
significance. Third, it should be possible to develop valid standards of comparison. Last, it should
lend itself to verifiable procedure of collection and analysis of data.
</p>

<h1>
Objective
</h1>

<p>
	A descriptive study aims at identifying the various characteristics of a community _or institution
or problem under study, but it does not deal with the testing of proposition or hypothesis. However
it “can reveal potential relationships between variables thus setting the stage for more elaborate
investigation later.”11

    A descriptive study also aims at a classification of the range of elements comprising the subject
matter of study. The classification must satisfy two criteria, viz., (1) exhaustiveness and (2) mutual
exclusiveness. Exhaustiveness is achieved when all the important elements are identified. Mutual
exclusiveness occurs when each item can be unambiguously placed in only one category in the
system. Descriptive information should also be useful for explanation, prediction and awareness
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00047">47</pagenum>

<h1>
	Descriptive Study vs. Analytical Study, page no:47
</h1>

<p>
	A descriptive study identifies relevant variables but does not aim at testing hypothesis. On the
other hand, an analytical study is primarily concerned with testing hypothesis and specifying and
interpreting relationships.

    A descriptive study 1S relatively less limited by the rigorous requirements of measurement and
analysis than an analytical study. An analytical study’ s design approximates to the model of an
experimental design.

    A descriptive study employs simple statistical techniques like averages and percentages, but an
analytical study employs advanced statistical techniques like correlation and multivariate analysis.
</p>

<h1>
Usefulness
</h1>

<p>
The descriptive studies are useful in their own way.

1. They have much to contribute to the development of a young science, as descriptive
  information can focus directly on a theoretical point. It may be useful in verifying focal
  concepts through empirical Observation. “The more adequate the description, the greater is
  the likelihood the units derived from the description will be useful 1n subsequent theory
  building.”12

2. Descriptive information can highlight important methodological aspects of data collection
  and interpretation. The collection of factual data increases our awareness of the relative
  accuracy of our measuring devices. Thus, our ability to accumulate further knowledge is
  significantly broadened.

3. Descriptive information obtained in a research may be useful for prediction about areas of
  social life outside the boundaries of the research.

4. Descriptive studies are valuable in providing facts needed for planning social action
   programmes.
</p>

<h1>
Limitations
</h1>

<p>
The descriptive method of study has certain limitations:

 1. It is not applicable to problems, which cannot satisfy the required criteria mentioned earlier.

 2. The researcher may make description an end in itself. Research must lead to discovery of
    facts.

 3. Although social science problems are continuous and have a past and a future, the researcher
    may lose himself 1n current conditions only.

 4. The researcher may tend to over-use statistics. In making statistical analysis, its limitations
    should be recognized.
</p>

<h1>
	                         3.5 DIAGNOSTIC STUDY, page no:48
</h1>

<h1>
	Meaning
</h1>

<p>
	This is similar to descriptive study but with a different focus. It is directed towards discovering
what is happening, what is it happening and what can be done about. It aims at identifying the causes
of a problem and the possible solutions for it.
</p>

<h1>
Purpose
</h1>

<p>
	A diagnostic study may also be concerned with discovering and testing whether certain variables
are associated, e.g., are persons hailing from rural areas more suitable for manning the rural branches
of banks? Do more villagers than city- voters vote for a particular party?
</p>

<h1>
Requirements
</h1>

<p>
	Both descriptive and diagnostic studies share common requirements, viz., prior knowledge of
the problem, its thorough formulation, clear-cut definition of the given population, adequate methods
for collecting accurate information, precise measurement of variables, statistical analysis and test of
significance. As the aim is to obtain complete and accurate information about a given situation
phenomenon, the research design must make much more provision for protection against bias than is
required in an exploratory study. Moreover, the amount of work involved is considerable and so
concern with economy of research effort is extremely important.
</p>

<h1>
Diagnostic Study vs. Descriptive Study
</h1>

<p>
	Though these two types of studies have in common emphasis on the specific characteristics of
given phenomenon, they differ from each other in some respects.

   First, a diagnostic study 18 more directly concerned with causal relationships and with implications
for action than is a descriptive study.

   Second, while a descriptive study IS oriented towards finding out what is occurring, a diagnostic
study 1s directed towards discovering not only what is occurring but why it is occurring and what can
be done about it.

   Third, a diagnostic study is more actively guided by hypothesis than is a descriptive study.

   Last, a diagnostic study is not possible in areas where knowledge is not advanced enough to
make possible adequate diagnosis. In such cases, the social scientist limits his effort to descriptive
studies.
</p>

	                             3.6 EVALUATION STUDIES
</h1>

<h1>
Meaning
</h1>

<p>
	Evaluation study is one type of applied research. It is made for assessing the effectiveness of
social or economic programmes implemented (e .g., family planning scheme) or for assessing the
impact of developmental projects (e. g., irrigation project) on the development of the project area.

    Suchman defines evaluation as "determination of the results attained by some activity (whether
a programme, a drug or a therapy or an approach) designed to accomplish some valued goal or
objective.”13
</p>

<p>
	13. Suchman, Edward A., Evaluative Research, New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 1967, pp. 31-32.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00049">49</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:49
</h1>

<h1>
Purpose
</h1>

<p>
	Evaluative research is thus, directed to assess or appraise the quality and quantity of an activity
and it performance, and to specify its attributes and conditions required for it success. It is also
concerned with change over time. As suchman puts it, “evaluative research asks about the kind of
change the  program views as desirable, the means by which the change is to be brought about, and
the signs according to which such change can be recognized.”
</p>

<h1>
Types of Evaluation
</h1>

<p>
Evaluation are of three types:

1. Concurrent evaluation: This is a continuous process and partakes the nature of an inspection
   or social audit of an on-going programme. It aims at the evaluation of the quality
   implementation and services as a feed back for improving the performance.

2. Periodic evaluation: This is made after each distinct phase or state of a project has been
   completed. In the case of a medium period time- bound programme like 5-year plan, this
   evaluation may be done 1n the middle of the period and it may be called midterm/ interim
   evaluation.

3. Terminal evaluation: This is done after the completion of a programme or project (e.g., an
   irrigation project). This is designed to assess the extent of the achievement of its goals or
   objectives. It may also involve a benefit— cost analysis. In the case of a project with long-
   gestation period (e.g., an irrigation project), the appropriate methodology for terminal
   evaluation will consist of a survey- cum experimental design.

See section 3.8 Experimental Research, below:
</p>

<h1>
Criteria of Evaluation Research
</h1>

<p>
   Weiss14 and Coleman” list a number of specific criteria, which distinguish evaluative research
form other types of research.

   First, evaluation research is usually conducted for a client who intends to use the finding as a
basis for decision — making. This is quite different from basic research, which aims at knowledge for
its own sake.

   Second the evaluation researcher deals with his client’s questions relating to the latter’ s
programme, while the basic researcher formulates his own research questions.

  Third, the evaluation researcher measures whether the programme goals are being reached.
other Scientific researchers concern themselves with ‘what is’ rather than with comparisons of ‘what
is’ with ‘what ought to be’.

  Fourth, unlike basic researcher who normally has control over research work, the evaluation
researcher works in a setting where priority goes to the programme as opposed to the evaluation. This
means that the evaluation researcher must ﬁt time schedule to the programme /project’ s built- in time
schedule. The programme staff tend to see data- collection work as hindrance to their work.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00050">50</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:50
</h1>

<p>
	Fifth, researcher- programme personnel conflicts are inherent in evaluation study. While the
researcher is interested in objective evaluation and public dissemination of results, the project personnel
expect that the evaluation results should be meant for in- house use only.

    Nevertheless, evaluation research does not differ from other types of research in methodology
The problems of reliability, validity and operationalization and research method, techniques and
principles are common to evaluation and other types of research.
</p>

<h1>
Design and Measurement
</h1>

<p>
An evaluation researcher must plan his design as to probe deeper into the following question

1. What is the nature of content of the objectives of the programme to be evaluated?

2. Are the objectives unitary or multiple?

3. How are the objectives to be achieved?

4. Who is the target of the programme?

5. When is the desired change to take place?

6. What is the desired magnitude of effect?

7. Do the benefits really reach the target group?

8. What are the unintentional effects or side effects of the programme?
</p>

<p>
	The evaluation researcher’s operationalization is concerned with one or more of the following
indicators:

   1. Effort or activity (i. e., input) variables.

   2. Performance or programme output in terms of the policy objectives.

   3. Adequacy of performance (one common index of adequacy is “the rate of effectiveness x
      the number of people exposed to the programme”)16

   4. Efficiency — a measure of benefit- cost.

   5. Process —— measures why the programme is successful or unsuccessful-
</p>

<p>
A few types of special designs suitable for evaluation research are:

1. Social audits: These are a useful means of getting at process and efficiency. They aim at
   examining: How much of resource inputs actually reaches the intended recipients in some
   form (i. e., cash subsidy, food and clothing for flood victims)? Of that portion which does
   not reach them, where does this loss of input go? Does the intended change take place? Etc.

2. Beneﬁt- cost analysis: This is made in order to measure the programme efficiency and to
   measure its effectiveness by comparison with alternative programmes. This analysis depends
   on availability of reliable and valid data. Monetary costs can be easily estimated, but man1
   social costs are purely speculative. For example, how could one financially measure the
   anguishes of rape, the emotional costs of assault or murder? Some social costs can be
   rationally dealt with, e. g., the social costs of total disability of an industrial employer arising
   out of injury could be measured in terms of society’ s loss of the disabled person’s work
   power and the loss of his potential tax amount.

<h1>
	Meaning
</h1>

<p>
	Action research is a type of evaluation study. It is a concurrent evaluation study of an action
programme  launched for solving a problem/ for improving an existing situation.

    In the quest for development, advancement, excellence and promotion of welfare of people,
government, institutions and voluntary agencies undertake action programmes for achieving specific
goals objectives. Land reform programmes, agricultural extension programmes, social welfare
programmes, human resource development programmes, managerial improvement programmes, rural
,Iment programmes, programmes for Improving the quality of life 1n factories and ofﬁces, etc.,
are some examples of action programmes. This plethora of development programme has given impetus
to action research. With the pressing need to assess the relative effectiveness of different approaches
to the same goal or the worthwhileness of one goal as against another, research has been called upon
to  play a closer and relevant role for action. The criterion of relevance for action is of critical
importance in action research.
</p>

<h1>
Typologies of Action Research
</h1>

 <p>
     Prospero R. Covar17 categorizes action research into five types.

     Type I: Classical design: Research and action are separate and independent. The connection
between research and action is not purposely sought. It may occur by chance. Action programme
agency may not know /use the research finding. The researcher may not deliberately gear his work
toward contributing to the effectiveness of an action programme.

     Type II: Interdependence of action and research: Action is carried out by an agency not
connected with a research institution. Research on action may be entrusted to an independent research
body. For example, government may launch a development programme and a university social scientist
may be welcomed to study the on- going programme. The researcher may include in his report a
section on implications for action, and give a copy of the report to the implementing agency, but he
had further obligation to the action programme.

   Type III: Evaluate research built into an action programme: In this case, research is dependent
upon action, and the action people define the scope of the research.

   Type IV: Action for research: Here the activities of the action programme are designed and
modified to carry out tests of hypothesis of research. For example, a researcher may wish to test the
relative effectiveness of three different methods of introducing family planning information: personal
contact with the wife, personal contact with both husband and wife, and impersonal contact through
the mass media alone. For this research purpose, a family planning programme applying each approach
to different groups of couples with similar characteristics and under similar circumstances has to be
launched. Thus, the research requirements dictate how the action will be carried out.

   Type V: Research- cum- action: Action and research go together as a joint endeavour. Researcher
and decision makers jointly design and launch the action programme and research on it. Once the
operational. design is completed and action launched, they record what happens under specified
conditions. They may vary the conditions if they want.

<h1>
Evaluation in Action Research, page no:52
</h1>

	Action research always has an evaluative component. As an action programme is designed to
bring about some change, an action research usually studies the following questions as proposed by
Hinkle:18

<p>
1. What is it that has changed?

2. How much has it changed (extent)?

3. How quickly has it changed (rate)?

4. What were the conditions before and after the change?

5. What were the stimuli that induced change?

6. What occurred during the transition?

7. Through what mechanisms did change occur?

8. What brought stabilization at a particular point in change?

9. Can directionality be observed in the change?
</p>

<p>
These questions indicate the problem areas, which can be the focus of evaluation. They are.
 (a) Impact of the programme on intended recipients.

 (b) Extent of the programmes effect on the intended recipients.

 (c) Time involved in bringing about the impact of effects.

 (d) Before- after measures of the variables, which are supposed to undergo change.

 (e) Identification of the events and processes that took place between the before- and
    measures.

 (f) Analysis of the subject matter or content of the programme.

 (g) Organizational, structural and operational aspects of the programme.

 (h) Factors in the change introduced.

 (i) Direction of the changes observed relative to the objectives of the programme.
</p>

<h1>
	The Phases in the Action Research
</h1>

<p>
	The different phases in the action research are:

(1) a baseline survey of the pre-action situation;

(2) a feasibility study of the proposed action programme;

(3) planning and launching the programme;

(4) concurrent evaluation of the programme;

(5) making modifications and changes in the programme and its method of implementation in
the light of the research findings; and

(6) final evaluation, if the programme is time- bound.

<h1>
TYPES AND METHODS OF RESEARCH, page no:53
</h1>


<p>

The success of the action research depends on the cooperation of action implementing people and
the beneflciaries of the action program.
</p>

<p>
 The Action Research Model developed and adopted by Akhilesh and Ganguly in their study
on organizational Development through participation and communication programme (1980) provides
in good illustration for action research. This model embodies six major steps:
</p>

<p>
1) Diagnosis, (2) sharing of diagnostic information, (3) planning: developing change programme,
(4) initiation of organizational change, (5) implementation of participation and communication
process, (6) post-experimental evaluation. This action research attempted to solve the actual
problems in work situation in a large public sector organization at Bangalore through
participation and communication program. This research was mostly successful in bridging the
perceived gap between the item practiced and the system desired and demonstrated the efficacy of
the action research as active approach to organization development.

<h1>
3.8 EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH
introduction
</h1>
<p>

 There are various phenomena such as motivation, productivity, development and operational
which are influenced by various variables. It may become necessary to assess the effect
of one particular variable or one set of variables on a phenomenon. This need has given rise to
experimental research.

</p>

<h1>
Meaning
</h1>

<p>
Experimental research is designed to assess the effects of particular variables on phenomenon by
keeping the other variables .constant or controlled. It aims at determining whether and in what
manner variables are related to each other. The factor, which is influenced, by other factors is
called dependent variable, and the other factors, which influence it, are known as independent
variables. for example, agricultural productivity, i.e., crop yield per hectare is a dependent
variable and  the factor such as soil fertility, irrigation, quality of seed, manuring
and cultural practices which influence the yield are independent variables.
</p>

<p>
The nature of relationship between independent variables and dependent variables is perceived
ﬂ stated in the form of causal hypothesis. A closely controlled procedure is adopted to test them.
the testing of the hypothesis is described in detail in Section 5.4 Hypothesis of Chapter 5,below.
</p>

<h1>
	procedure
</h1>

<p>
Two identical groups are selected. These should be ‘identical’ in terms of the Characteristics of
the phenomenon under study. For example, in a farm productivity experiment, two plots of farmland
th same soil composition, soil fertility, same size, same climate and same irrigation facility   should selected for the study.
</p>



<p>
One of the groups is used as experimental group, and the other as control group. Experimental
group  is exposed to an experimental variable or stimatulus. Control group is not exposed to the
experimental variable The difference between the experimental and control groups’ outcome is
attributed to the effect of the experimental variable.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00054">54</pagenum>


<h1>
	page no : 54
</h1>
 <p>
 illustration: An agricultural scientist desires to study the impact of application of a
 particular chemical fertilizer (say urea) on the yield of a crop.
</p>

<p>
He selects two identical plots of land 1n a farm. All conditions — soil fertility, climate,
irrigation, cultural practice — are the same. Thus, all variables are kept constant.
</p>

<p>

In the experimental plot alone, he applied chemical fertilizer. This is the only variation
between the two plots. Hence the difference in yield is attributable to the application of the
chemical fertilizer
</p>

<p>
In some cases, a single group may be used as both control and experimental group. For example
a cooperative extension worker wants to know the effect of a member- education program on the
cooperative knowledge of the members of a cooperative. He selects a cross section of members
a society at random. He measures the type and extent of cooperative knowledge of the group. He
then  exposes them to a member- education program. He again measures their knowledge. The
different in knowledge can be attributed to the program.
</p>

<h1>
condition
</h1>

<p>
From an analysis of the above procedure, the conditions required for an experimental study my.
be identified. They are:
</p>.

<p>
1. It should be possible for selecting exactly identical groups. This possibility exists in
physical and natural sciences, but not so in social sciences, which deal with human life. It is
difﬁcult to find exactly identical groups of persons. We may get approximately similar groups only

2. The target groups should be amenable for experimentation. This is ensured in physical sciences.
but human beings may not always be willing to be subject to experimentation.

3. It should be possible to identify all the independent variables that affect the dependent
variables under study. This again is ensured in physical sciences, but not in social phenomena as
our knowledge of human mind and behaviour is limited. ’

4. It should be possible to keep non— experimental variables constant so as to study the effect
of experimental variables on the phenomenon. Such close controls over the subject variable
are possible in laboratory experimentation. But they are almost impossible in human life
situations, which are dynamic and complex. Thus, strictly controlled experimentation
rarely feasible with human beings.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, useful and fairly valid experimental research is possible in several areas of social
sciences such as economic development, welfare programs, social education, teaching technology,
political administration, industrial and agricultural finance, management of enterprises and
institution so on. It IS possible to achieve reasonable degree of validity by adopting
appropriate techniques as explained in Section 5.6: Measurement of Chapter 5, below.
</p>

<h1>
Types of Experimental Designs
</h1>

<p>
The major types of experimental designs are:
1. After— only design

2. One group Before- after design

3. Before- after design with control group.

</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00055">55</pagenum>

<h1>
page no: 55
</h1>

<p>
after - only design: This 1s the simplest type of experimental design. The effect on dependent
variable (Y) is assessed by measuring it in both experimental (E) and control (C) groups after E
has been to an independent variable (X). In a fertilizer application experiment cited above the
1 (Y) is measured in both E and C plots, after the experiment is over. The difference is
1 to the application of chemical fertilizer (X).
    E  ye
    C  ye
 </p>

<p>
 2 One group before- after design: In this design the same group is used as E and C, measuring
Y before and after, the group has been exposed to X. Suppose a researcher wants to evaluate the
effectiveness of a film in changing attitude towards drinking and driving. He may employ this
second design. The change in score on an attitude test given on the target group before and after
seeing the  film measures the film’s effect.
</p>

<p>

3. Before -after design with control group: In this design, both the E and C groups are measured
before and after E  is exposed to X. This is a better design than the previous ones. This
eliminates the  impact of extraneous factors occurring during time period.


Before  After
E Ye1 Ye2
C Ye1 Ye2

Difference in E= Ye2- ye1 =De
Difference in C= Ye2- ye1 =dc
net Difference De - De
</p>

<h1>
Evaluation of Experimental Research
</h1>

<p>
 the use of experimental designs in social science research is complicated. It is difficult to
establish comparable experimental and control groups. There are limits to experimentation among
human beings. Experiment is often difficult to design; it is expensive and time consuming. It can
be to study the present only, and cannot be used for studies of the past or the future.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, experimentation has certain unique advantages. No other method can equal
experimentation in objectivity and in studying causal relationships between variables. The effect
of extraneous variables can be controlled more effectively in experimental design than in other
designs. Above all, an  experimental design offers a means for testing social values.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00056">56</pagenum>
 <p>
	page no: 57
</p>

<h1>
Quasi- Experimental Designs
</h1>

The relationships studied by scientists, according to Rosenberg, may be classified into following
kinds:

<h1>
1. Stimulus -response relationship:
</h1>

<p>
It is characterized by an independent specific external variable with a dependent variable being
a particular response to it, e. g., relationships between reward and satisfaction; between
advertisement and consumption patterns.*
</p>

<h1>
2. One- shot case study:
</h1>

<p>
This involves an observation of a single group at one point in time usually subsequent to an
event supposed to have produced change, e.g., a study of a rural community after a rural
development  program; study of a political system after a general election.
</p>

<p>
This is a study of only what exists at the time of study; therefore, it has no control
over extrinsic intrinsic factors. Besides, it does not allow for manipulation of the independent
variable or before— after or control- -experimental group comparison. Further, a case
study analyses a single unsampled system, it is weak on generalization as well. It has also no
checks on internal validity and thus is of little use in testing causal relations. However,
this study is useful in exploratory research.
</p>

<h1>
3. Cross- section study (or correlation design):
</h1>

<p>
This is  the most predominant design employed in survey research. It is an attempt to approximate
the after- only control group design by using cross tabulations and statistical techniques like
correlation and multi-variate analysis. (see Chapter Statistical Analysis, below) .
</p>

<p>
A sample of individuals is drawn and data relating to their background characteristics and
dependent variables under study are collected from them. For example, to test a hypothesis:
“the birth rates vary inversely with socio-economic status.” Data may be collected from a
sample of families  belonging to various socio- economic levels; the relations between variables
may be studied by using correlation technique. The important limitation of this analysis is
that the time order of direction causation cannot be easily determined.
</p>

<h1>
4. Ex-post -facto-design:
</h1>

<p>
This is a variation of the correlational design. It provides a partial solution to the
time order problem. This is retrospective or after -the- event study. It looks from past to the
present.
</p>

<p>
It requires information about the past by asking retrospective questions regarding an earlier
period. For example, an investigator desiring to assess the effect of a family planning publicity
program on the attitude of women could ask them about their present views as well as about their
views before their exposure to the publicity program. The drawback of this approach is the bias
arising out of respondent’s memory distortions. A partial solution is to introduce checks
for detecting  gross inaccuracies in the memory of respondents.
</p>

<h1>
3.9 ANALYTICAL STUDY OR STATISTICAL METHOD
</h1>

<h1>
meaning
</h1>

<p>
analytical study is a system of procedures and techniques of analysis applied to quantitative
data consist of a system of mathematical models or statistical techniques applicable to numerical
data. it is also known as the Statistical Method. (For detailed discussion see chapter 11:
statistical Analysis)
</p>

<h1>
Aim
</h1>

<p>
This study aims at testing hypothesis and specifying and interpreting relationships. It
concentrates on analyzing data in depth and examining relationships from various
angles by bringing in as many variables as possible in the analysis plan.
</p>

<h1>
Uses
</h1>
This method is extensively used in business and other fields in which quantitative numerical
data generated. It is used for measuring variables, comparing groups and examining association
between  factors.

<p>
Data may be collected from either primary sources or secondary sources.
</p>

<p>
There is vast scope for making analytical studies by using data published by various Departments
of Government and institutions like the Reserve Bank of India, Bureau of Public Enterprise, NABARD
central Statistical Organization.
</p>

<h1>
Analytical Study Vs. Experimental Research
</h1>

<p>
One way to distinguish Analytical studies from experimental research is that the former rely
heavily on the post- facto- analysis of data generally collected in a natural or real- life
setting or from records unlike descriptive studies, analytical studies are characterized by
rigorous requirements of measurement and analysis, and design approximated to the model of an
experimental design.
</p>

<h1>
3.10 HISTORICAL RESEARCH
</h1>

<h1>
meaning
</h1>

<p>
Historical study is a study of past records and other information sources with a view to
reconstructing the origin and development of an institution or a movement or a system and
discovering the trends in the past.
</p>

<p>
It is  descriptive in nature. It 1s a difficult task; it must often depend upon inference and
logical of recorded data and indirect evidences rather than upon direct observation. Hence, it is
aptly described  “the induction of principles through research into the past and social forces
which have the present.”
</p>

<h1>
Objectives
</h1>

<p>
It is objective is to draw explanations and generalizations from the past trends in order to
understand and to anticipate the future. It enables us to grasp our relationship with the past
and to more intelligently for the future. The past contains the key to the present and the past
and the influences the future. Historical study helps us in visualizing the society as a dynamic
organism and its structures and functions as evolving, steadily growing and undergoing change and
transformation.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00058">58</pagenum>






<h1>
Sources of Data,page no:5
</h1>

<p>
The sources of data for historical research consists of (l) eyewitness accounts narrated by an
actual observer or participant in an event, (2) oral testimony by elders, (3) records and other
documentary materials and (4) relics. The data available from the above sources may be scattered
and discontinuous and fragmented. Personal accounts are mostly subjective and so should be studied
with great caution and corroborated with documentary evidences. The origin and genuineness of the
sources and the validity of facts contained in them should be critically tested and examined.
Their authenticity should tested. Only authentic sources should be depended upon for collection of
data. It is essential check and cross—check the data from as many sources as possible.
</p>

<h1>
Steps in Historical Method
</h1>

<p>
First, the feasibility of the study should be examined. The researcher should see whether the
selected problem lends itself to historical analysis. It should be one of tracing and
describing the past or relating to the recent past to draw out its significance for the present
and the future. It should be feasible in terms of his research ability, time and cost.
</p>

<p>
Second, the selected problem should be formulated and the plan of study should be designed
Third, the sources of data should be located.
Fourth, the genuineness of the sources and the validity of the facts contained in them should be
tested.
Fifth, relevant facts should be collected from the authentic sources and they should be checked
and cross-checked.
Sixth, the facts should be arranged into a logical sequence and this synthesis of facts is the
basis for rebuilding of the past situation.
Last, by adopting induction process meaningful interpretations and generalizations should be
made.
</p>

<p>
The quality of a historical study depends on the relevance, adequacy and completeness of factor
collected, their reliability, and the ingenuity of the researcher in classifying and integrating
them in drawing inferences.
</p>

<h1>
Limitations and Difficulties
</h1>

<p>
As the historical study is concerned with the past, reliable and adequate data may not be
available. The remoter is the past, the greater is difficulty in obtaining relevant facts.
</p>


<p>
It is also diﬁicult to test the genuineness and authenticity of sources and the data available
from them. Personal biases and private interpretations often enter unconsciously. ‘
</p>


<p>
It is diﬁicult to establish the time order of events.
</p>

<p>
The records available“ are not kept in the order and with the precision that a researcher exn'
Hence, his inferences may not be full or accurate.
</p>

<p>
The dispersal of documents is another limitation. The researcher may not succeed in bloc.
</p>

<p>
It is diﬁicult to perceive the real significance of the data because of their remote time periods
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00059">59</pagenum>

<h1>
	   page no:59
</h1>

<p>
  Further, in historical research, precise measurements, verifications and replication are not possible.

  Nevertheless, a thorough and systematic historical study is of immense use in understanding the
past and drawing drawing inferences for the present and future.
</p>

<h1>
	                     3.11 SURVEYS
</h1>

<h1>
Meaning
</h1>

<p>
	survey is a ‘fact finding’ study. It is a method of research involving collection of data directly
from a population or a sample thereof at particular time. It must not be confused with the mere clerical
routine of gathering and tabulating figures. It requires expert and imaginative planning, careful analysis
and rational interpretation of the findings.

    data may be collected by observation, or interviewing or mailing questionnaires.

    The analysis of data may be made by using simple or complex statistical techniques depending
upon the objectives of the study.
</p>

<h1>
The characteristics of Survey Method
</h1>

<p>
The survey method has certain Characteristics:

1. It is  always conducted in a natural setting: it is a field study.

2. It seeks responses directly from the respondents.

3. It can cover a very large population, thanks to sampling techniques.

4. A survey may involve an extensive study or an intensive study. An extensive study covers
   a wider sample. An intensive one covers a few samples and tends to ‘dig deeper’. These two
   approaches serve different ends, where generalization or estimation is necessary, the extensive
   approach is useful, but where one wants to make an indepth study of some aspects of a
   subject- matter, the intensive approach is preferable.

5. A survey covers a definite geographical area: a city, or a district, or a state.

   The quality of a survey depends upon the thoroughness of the planning, the soundness of
sampling ,the adequacy and reliability of data, the quality of analysis and the interpretation of the
findings.
</p>

<h1>
Step involved in a Survey
</h1>

<p>
    The sequence of the tasks involved in carrying out a survey from the first of planning to the
final stage of preparing the report is presented below:

1. Selection of a problem and its formulation,

2. Preparation of the research design,

3. Operationalization of concepts and construction of measuring indexes and scales,

4. Sampling,

5. Construction of tools for collection of data and their pre-test,

6. Field work and collection of data,

7. Processing of data and tabulation,

 9. Reporting.

All these steps are discussed in detail in the relevant chapters.
</p>

<h1>
The Purposes of Surveys
</h1>

<p>
	Survey serves several purposes:

1. The purpose of many surveys such as population census, socio—economic surveys, expenditure
   surveys, marketing surveys etc., is simple to, provide information to government or planners
   or business enterprises. These surveys have a descriptive purpose. In short, all fact- finding
   surveys have this purpose.

2. Many enquiries aim to explain certain phenomena. Their function is to test hypotheses, to
   explain the causal relationships between variables and to assess the influences or various
   factors on a given phenomenon like job- satisfaction, labour productivity and consumer
   behaviour. Surveys aiming at explanation involve indepth analysis and complete
   interpretations.

3. Surveys may be designed to make comparisons of demographic groups (e.g., comparison of
   low income groups with high income groups) or real groups, e.g., work groups in factories
   or offices. Comparison of behavioural or attitudinal groups can also be made. For example
   in a factory, the attitudes of high- production workers toward the company may be compare
   with the attitudes of low- production workers.

4. Surveys concerned with cause and effect relationships can be useful for making predictions
   For example, if relationships between income increases and purchase of durable goods are
   established in a consumer behaviour survey, a prediction about future demand for durable
   goods with reference to anticipated income increases can be made. A survey of people
   future plans and intentions is another approach to make predictions. This is one of the
   methods adopted for demand forecasts.
</p>

<h1>
The Subject -matter of Surveys
</h1>

<p>
	All aspects of human behaviour, social institutions, economic system, and business undertaking
lend themselves to surveys. The subject matter of surveys may be broadly categorized into:
</p>

<h1>
A: Social Surveys
</h1>

<p>
1. Demographic characteristics of a group of people
2. Social environment of people
3. People’s opinions and attitudes
4. People’s behaviour and activities.
</p>

<h1>
B: Economic Surveys
</h1>

<p>
1. Economic conditions of people
2. Working of economic units
3. Operations of an economic system.
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00061">61</pagenum>

<h1>
	    page no:61
</h1>

<p>
   Demographic characteristics include family composition, marital status, fertility age and so on.
population census is primarily on the demographic aspects of people. All social surveys include some
demographic aspects.
</p>

<p>
  Social environment covers all social factors, hoUsing conditions and social amenities and social
institutions.
</p>

<p>
  Surveys of opinions and attitudes deal with various issues (e g., direct V.s indirect election of
the head of government), systems (e. g., democracy) and schemes and programmes (e. g., family
planning).
  People’s activities refer to ‘what people do’, e. g., use of leisure time, newspaper reading, and
recreation  etc people’s behaviour is concerned with their consumption pattern, life- style, organizational
behaviour, group dynamics etc.
</p>
 <p>
  Economic conditions include occupation, income, saving, investment, assets, etc.,
</p>

 <p>
  Economic units refer to shops, business firms, financial institutions, etc. Economic system may
refer to capitalism, cooperative system, socialism and mixed economy.
</p>

<h1>
Fields of Application
</h1>

 <p>
	 the above discussion of the subject -matter of surveys, it is apparent that the survey method
is applicable to various fields and disciplines such as sociology, economics, behavioural sciences,
political science, public health, commerce and management. Surveys may be considered to be belonging
to a particular discipline like sociology or economics or political science. Surveys of group belonging,
leader -follower relations, of family life etc., belong to sociology; studies of income, expenditure, and
savings may be classified as economic surveys; studies of voting, of participation in political movements
and of political attitudes of people belong to political science And so on.
</p>

<p>
	Such classification however, are somewhat arbitrary. All surveys are essentially interdisciplinary
and contribute to the integration of separate disciplines. For example, economic or political surveys
have something to do with people’s sociological or psychological aspects.
</p>

 <p>
    Survey research has no specific disciplinary anchor point. Specialists 1n all fields of social and
behavioural sciences use it. It broadens the empirical base of various fields. It also provides data for,
interdisciplinary  analysis.
</p>

<p>
   Survey can be used as a tool for both basic and applied research. They are extensively used
by planning bodies and by policy-makers in government both for formulating plans and programmes
and for evaluating them. The survey method is also widely used by business enterprises in their
 research of markets, consumer preferences and buying habits, environment, training needs effectiveness
of advertisement and the like.
</p>

<p>
	Above all, the survey method makes a very significant contribution to the growth of knowledge
in social sciences.
</p>

 <p>
	many outstanding researches in social sciences would have been impossible without the modern
survey method.
</p>

<h1>
Coverage of Surveys: Census Vs. Sample
</h1>

<p>
	A survey may cover all the units of a given universe. Then it is called a census survey. If the
survey covers a fraction of the universe, then it is called sample survey. ((See chapter 6: Sampling).
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00062">62</pagenum>

<h1>
	   page no:62
</h1>

<p>
	A survey may cover a small, highly selected universe as well as a broad segment of the
population depending on the nature of the problems studied. For example, such specialized studies
as a study of political leadership, a study of managerial style of top business executives, a study of
factors affecting industrial location etc., cover only a specific selected small universe. On the other
hand, general surveys like poverty studies, survey of expenditure pattern, consumer behaviour studies
credit surveys, etc., cover broad segments of population and are usually designed as sample surveys
The development of large -scale sampling methods has made fact- collecting along methodologically
sound lines much easier.
</p>

<h1>
Advantages/ Merits of Survey Research
</h1>

<p>
The major advantages of a survey method are:

1. The versatility of the survey method is its greatest strength. It is the only practical way to
  collect many types of information from individuals, such as personal characteristics, socio-
  economic data, attitudes, opinions, experiences and expectations.

2. The survey method facilitates drawing generalizations about large populations on the basis,
  of studies of representative sample.

3. The survey method is flexible to permit the use of various methods of collection of
   observation interviewing and mailing.

4. Surveys sensitize the researcher to unanticipated or unknown problems. The collection of
   data from respondents through interviewing or mailing often uncovers facts previously
   unknown to the researcher.

5. Surveys are useful instruments for verifying theories.
</p>

<h1>
Limitations
</h1>

<p>
	Although survey method is a research instrument of great versatility and extensive applications
it has certain limitations:

1. Survey method is primarily meant for collection of data from primary sources: individuals
   households and institutions; hence its feasibility depends upon the willingness and Cooperation
   of the respondents.

2. A sample survey is subject to sampling error. (See Section 6.5 of Chapter 6). Its finding
   must be interpreted in the light of this error. ‘

3. The survey method depends primarily on verbal behaviour. The respondent can give untrue
  or misleading answers. Hence, a survey is subject to response errors. (See Sections 7.8 and
  7.10 of Chapter 7).

4. A survey is also subject to the errors of measurement implicit in quantifying attitudes
   abilities, behaviour and other personal traits. (See Section 6.5 of Chapter 6).

5. There is a limit of the number of items of information that can be collected in a single
   survey. There is an optimal length of time for an interview. Beyond that point, interview
   weariness sets in. Hence the extent of data requirement should be delimited to the tolerance
   level of respondents.

<p>
6. A sample survey designed to represent a population over a wider geographical area may not
   give adequate representation to any population characteristic, which is highly localized.
   This means that the influences of specific local social groups cannot be assessed through
   a national survey.

7. The survey method alone is inadequate to analyze adequately the complex fabric of social
    organization It is also not well suited to studies of historical development.

5. Survey is very expensive in terms of time and cost. Hence, an individual cannot afford to
   carry out an extensive survey out of his resources.

	                          3.12 CASE STUDY
</h1>

 <p>
	A study is an in-depth comprehensive study of a person, a social group, an episode, a
process, a situation, a programme, a community , an institution or any other social unit.
</p>

<p>
   It is one of the most popular types of research methods. Its purpose may be to understand the
life cycle of the unit under study or the interaction between factors that explain the present status or
the development over a period of time. Some examples of a case study are: a social— anthropological
study of a rural or tribal community; a causative study of a successful cooperative society; a study
of the financial  health of a business undertaking; a study of labour participation in management in
a particular enterprise, a study of juvenile delinquency; a study of life- style of working women; a
study of slum dwellers; a study of urban poor; a study of economic offenses; a study of refugees from
 another country.
</p>

<h1>
	Functions
</h1>

<p>
	The case study method describes a case in terms of its peculiarities. It gives us an insight into
the typical or extreme cases whose unique features are not reflected by the usual statistical method.
</p>

 <p>
	A case study helps to secure a wealth of information about the unit of study, which may provide
clues and ideas for further research. It provides an opportunity for the intensive analysis of many
specific details that are overlooked in other methods.
</p>

<p>
    It examines complex factors involved in a given situation so as to identify causal factors
operating in it.
</p>

<p>
	A case study aims at studying everything about something rather than something about everything
as in the case of a statistical method.
</p>

<p>
	While in a statistical approach the ‘individual’ disappears from the analysis, in a case study the
‘individual’ representing the ‘wholeness’ is preserved, as it is an approach which views any social
unit as a whole. Thus, a case study gives us a total view of a unit or a clear insight into a situation
or process in its total setting. Thus, the perspective of a case study is both qualitative and organic.
It gives an overall generic picture of a problem.
</p>

<p>
	The case study, as a research method, often employs more techniques than one. Thus, for tracing
a developmental process, it uses historical method, it employs descriptive method where a factual
picture is needed, it employs interviewing, mail questionnaire, check lists, rating scales, etc., to gather
data, looks to statistics for testing hypotheses.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00064">64</pagenum>

<h1>
	           page no:64
</h1>

<p>
	The aim of a case study is to ascertain the generic development of a social unit under study
revealing the factors that moulded its life within its cultural setting. Because of its aid in studying
behaviour in specific, precise detail, Burgess termed the case study method as “the social microscope."2
</p>

<p>
	It is most valuable for diagnostic, administrative and therapeutic purposes.
</p>

<p>
	It develops ideas, sometimes leading to conclusion and sometimes to hypotheses to be tested
It may also be useful for developing new concepts or testing existing concepts.
</p>

<h1>
Case Study Vs. Survey
</h1>

<p>
	Case study may be conducted as an independent study or a supplementary investigation to a
survey. The primary distinctions between a case study and a survey lie in the intensity and depth of
investigation and its coverage.
</p>

<p>
1. While a survey is a broad based investigation of a phenomenon, a case study is an intension
   investigation.

2. A survey covers a large number of units — all units of a universe or a sample of them; but
   a case study is a study of a single unit/ group.

3. The findings of a study can be generalized when it is based on a representative sample
   whereas the findings of a case study cannot be generalized.

4. While a survey is useful for testing hypotheses about large social aggregates, a case study
   is useful for testing hypotheses about the structural and procedural characteristics (e. g.,
   status relation, interpersonal behaviour, managerial style) of a specific social unit (e .g.,
   organization, a small group or a community).
</p>

<h1>
Disadvantages /Limitations
</h1>

<p>
	The major disadvantages /limitation of case study are:

1. The most prominent disadvantage of case studies is their limited generalizability. As case
   studies of stray cases, they are not sufficient for making meaningful generalizations to largest
   social aggregates.

2. Case studies are generally more time- consuming than surveys.

3. Case study method is inadequate for an analysis of macro- problems.

4. The danger of investigator’s over-confidence is more in a case study. This leads to various
   biases such as errors of perception, judgement and over-emphasis of unusual events
   unwarranted extrapolation, and ad hoc theorizing and sweeping generalizations.
</p>

<h1>
Merits
</h1>

<p>
The merits of a case study method far exceeds its limitations.

1. Case studies are flexible with respect to data collection methods. All methods of data
   collection are useful to case studies.

2. A case study can extend virtually to any dimension of the topic studied. All aspects may
   be studied or specific aspects may be emphasized.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00065">65</pagenum>

<h1>
	        page no:65
</h1>

 <p>
3. Case studies may be conducted in practically any kind of social setting.

4.Case studies offer specific instances of tests of theories.

5.Case study is a highly fruitful approach for the purpose of group or process analysis as
  against the analysis of individual traits alone.

6.Case studies give to the researcher a wider range of insights into human life, which cannot
  be gained through a general survey.
</p>

<h1>
	                          3.13 FIELD STUDIES
</h1>

 <p>
   Filed studies are scientific enquiries aimed at discovering the relations and interactions among
sociological, psychological and educational variables in social institutions and actual life situations
like communities, schools, factories, organizations and institutions. A social or institutional situation
is selected and the relations among the attitudes, values, perceptions and behaviours of individuals
and groups in the selected situation are studied. Some examples of field studies are: Dollard’s study
of cast and class in a southern town,22 Malinowski’s investigations of the Trobriand Islanders23;
Lynd's study of Middletown24, Jone’s study of the socio-economic basis of class in Aknon, Ohio25;
Mann-kanitkau’s study of land and labour in a Deccan village26; Aiyyappan’s study of social
revolution  in a Kerala village. 27
</p>

<h1>
Field of Study Vs. Surveys
</h1>

<p>
	Although it is not easy to draw a fine logical distinction between survey and field study, there
are practical differences between them. First, a survey attempts to be representative of the universe
under study and thus calls for an adequate and representative sample. This emphasis on sampling
may or may not be found in a field study, because it is more concerned with a thorough account of the processes under study than with their typicality in a large universe.
</p>

<p>
	Second, while a field study aims at directly studying the interrelations of the parts of social
structure of a single community or a single group, a survey aims at covering a larger universe, and
it may be indirectly deal with social and psychological processes, through inference from the statistical
analysis rather than through direct observation, thus, field study will provide a more detailed natural
picture of social interrelations of the group than does a survey.
</p>

<h1>
Types of Field Studies
</h1>

<p>
	 Katz28 has classified field studies into (1) anthropological studies and (2) quantitative field
studies. In an anthropological study, the researcher lives in the selected community, observes its
people, talks with them at great length, and thus gains a thorough insight into the social structure of
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00066">66</pagenum>

<p>
	     page no:66
</p>

<p>
the community and the people’s life, culture and ideologies. But the anthropological  approach does
not aim at precise measurement of specific variables and relations.
</p>

<p>
	On the other hand, a social- psychological field study employs quantitative approach and measures
variables and their interrelationships. Newcomb's 8 research on Bennington College, a self- —contained
college community29 is an example for this type of study. The conclusions of a quantitative study can
be readily confirmed by other investigators.
</p>

<p>
	The conflict between the two approached can be resolved by utilizing anthropological approach
as the initial stage in a field study. In this stage, the situation as a whole can be studied and the
fundamental relationship 3 grasped. These insights can yield hypotheses which can be tested by a
detailed quantitative study. In the Festinger-Schachter-Back3O study of a processing community this
procedure was employed. In the combined approach, the initial anthropological study serves as an
exploratory stage and the subsequent quantitative study tests hypotheses derived from the exploratory
Stage.
</p>

<h1>
Steps in Field Study
</h1>
<p>
	Katz suggests a general model consisting of the following phases 31 in the conduct of a field
study: (1) preliminary planning, (2) the scouting expedition or the anthropological study, (3) the
formulation of the research design, (4) the pretesting of research instruments and procedures, (5) the
full- scale field operations, and (6) the analysis of materials.
</p>

<p>
	Preliminary planning: It IS better to start a field study with a tentative plan covering the scope
of the study, its broad objectives and time schedule. The plan will be finalized after the results of the
scouting expedition are available.
</p>

<p>
	The Scouting expedition: This phase of study involves an informal and free investigation in
which the field workers try to get a thorough understanding of the important forces in the situation.
The objective of this exploratory work is to identify the significant variables in the situation and group
behaviour. Informal procedures can be adopted for gathering information. They may include: consulting
informal leaders; contacting informants like newspaper reporters, local teachers etc., using discrepancies
in the accounts of informants as a basis for further exploration; living in the community and participating
in its activities; observing specific situations; studying available records and secondary sources. Field
workers should keep daily full records of their work and observations.
</p>

<p>
	Formulation of the. research design: On the basis of the results of the scouting exploration
the design of the final study can be formulated. It is important to delimit the scope of the study  and
to introduce controls into the data -collection process through standardization of tools and measurements.
</p>

<p>
	Pretesting of instruments and procedures: The interview schedules and behavioural scales
and other types of data forms required for the study should be constructed and pre-tested.
</p>

<p>
	Field operation: The full- scale field operation consists of several activities as explained in
Chapter 9: Field Work, below. The tasks for the field workers are more varied and often more difficult
than for the interviewers in a survey. The field worker must be able to enlist the cooperation of all
groups in the community and also be capable of interviewing the leaders.
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00067">67</pagenum>

<h1>
         page no:67
</h1>


<p>
	Analysis of materials: Data from observations and interview responses in a field study lend
themselves to correlation analysis. Correlation coefficients show the nature of relationships between
variables. By holding factors constant, the relationships are studied.
</p>

<h1>
Advantages
</h1>
 <p>
	There are certain natural advantages of field studies. First, a field study tends to continue over
a period of time, and so it is possible to maintain continued observation, ascertaining the timing of
certain variables.
</p>

<p>
	Second a field study provides opportunity for direct observation of interaction and of social
relationships in their natural occurrence In a survey, we can only make inferences about these
factors cannot directly observe them.
</p>

<p>
	A third advantage of a field study is the possibility of going beyond measures obtained from
a single instrument. The correlations from a single measuring instrument may be influenced by some
halo in its application. A field study permits the obtaining of reciprocal perceptions and interdependent
reaction from different groups of people whose behaviour is interrelated to make up a social structure.
Agreement in perceptions on the part of people standing at various points in the hierarchy gives
greater confidence in the validity of the reporting. For example, when workers, foremen and supervisors
in a department of a factory all agree about whether the foreman or supervisor has the greater power
in the department, we are on a much safer ground than if we had only the foremen or the supervisors
reporting on the situation.
</p>

<p>
   Last, a field study facilitates use of different independent measures: interviews with different
types of people, behavioural observations and study of available records. The relationships discovered
through different methods are more convincing than if they are derived from a single method.
</p>

<p>
   Thus, field studies are strong in realism, significance, strength of variables and reliability of findings.
</p>

<h1>
	Limitations
</h1>

<p>
	Despite these strengths, a field study has serious limitations. Its most serious weakness is its ex
post facto character. Thus, statements of relations are weaker than they are in experimental research.
The field  situation always has a plethora of variables. It is difficult to keep extraneous variables constant.
</p>

 <p>
	Another methodological weakness is lack of precision in the measurement of field variables due
to the greater complexity of field situations.
</p>

<p>
	There are also potential weaknesses such as problems of feasibility, cost, sampling and time.
</p>

<h1>
Usefulness
</h1>

<p>
	In building a science of social psychology, field studies have unique roles to play. They “can
give depth of understanding to survey findings” and “rich insights and hypotheses” to the experimenter.
There should be a two -way interaction between experimentation and field study. The findings of field
studies may yield hypotheses, which require more rigorous experimentation. Conversely, the
 experimental results may require field tests for establishing their reality and external validity.

	                 3.14 STEPS IN RESEARCH, page no:68
</h1>

<h1>
Introduction
</h1>

<p>
	The task of research is a sequential process involving a number of Clearly delineated steps.
There are some variations in the number of steps, their names and their sequence suggested by
different writers, but there is much similarity among their suggestions. No one however, claims that
the research process is truly linear, moving from one step after another in an order. Some steps may
be taken in a different order; some steps may have to be retraced; some may be carried on
simultaneously; some may be omitted; in some projects some steps can be covered quickly, while in
another cases, they may require longer time. In spite of these variations it is desirable to outline the
steps involved in the task of planning and executing a project, and also the order in which they have to be taken.
</p>

<h1>
Steps in Research
</h1>
<p>
	According to Emory, the research sequence consists of four major stages:32
</p>

<p>
	1. Exploration of the situation: If the problem is in an area in which the investigator has
previously conducted research, he may move quickly to the development Of the research proposal
including time and budget estimates. However, if the problem posed is an unfamiliar one, he may
adopt two -stage approach; first to propose a separate exploratory study, second, to move to development
of the main study after the exploratory study is over. The feasibility, the availability of data, etc. will be explored at this stage.

2. Development of the research design: At this stage, the formal research plan is developed.
(For details, see Section 5.7: Research Designs in Chapter 5).

3. Data collection: Data are collected by adopting appropriate methods of data collection.

4. Analysis and interpretation of the results: After the fieldwork is over, the data are processed.
tabulated and analyzed. Then the findings are interpreted. Finally, a report is written for communication
the findings.
</p>

<p>
	Pauline  V. Young classifies the phases of research process into: (1) Precise formulation of the
selected problem, (2) formulation of working or exploratory hypothesis, (3) observation and exploration
of the problem, (4) uniform recording of the data Obtained, (5) Classification of the data into series
and (6) scientific generalizing. 33
</p>

<p>
	These steps are not mutually exclusive; neither are they separate and district. they do not
necessarily follow each other in any special order. Some of them may re-enter after preliminary use
of them.34 For example, some preliminary observation is inevitable before an adequate working
hypothesis can be formulated. After its formulation, systematic observation is indispensable.
</p>

<p>
   Nachmias35 identify seven stages in the research process: problem, hypotheses, research design
measurement, data collection, data analysis and empirical generalizations.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00069">69</pagenum>

<h1>
	 page no:69
</h1>

<p>
	According to Vimal Shah, a research process involves the following major activities:36
</p>
<p>
1. Identification and selection of the research problem,
2. Choice of a theoretical framework for the research problem,
3. Formulation of the research problem,
4. Design of the experiment or inquiry,
5. Definition and measurement of variables,
6. Sampling procedures,
7. Tools and techniques for gathering data,
8. Coding, editing and processing of data,
9. Analysis of the data, and
10. Reporting research.
</p>

<p>
   The first three activities may be considered as the planning stage of a research.

Clover and Balsley37 present the following eleven- step outline:
</p>

<p>
1. Become aware of the problem
2. Deﬁne the problem and purpose of the research
3. Set forth hypotheses
4. Determine what information will be required
5. Decide which methods to use in collecting information
6. Collect information or evidence
7. Compile findings in a systematic form
8. Analyze findings to test hypotheses
9. Write a final research report
10.Make specific recommendation for actions
11.Conduct a follow- -up, if necessary.
</p>

<p>
	Roy G. Francis38 of the university of Minnesota lists twelve steps in scientific research:
-Selection of problem area
-Acquaintance with current theory and knowledge in the area
-Definition of the problem
-Development of hypotheses
-Development of the formal argument

</p>

<h1>
A General Model
</h1>

<p>
	In general, a research process consists of the following steps:

1. Identification and selection of a research problem.

2. Review of literature: Preliminary review prior to problem selection; Systematic review after selection; notes taking

3. Formulation of the selected problem: definition of the problem, conceptual mode, delimitations
   of the study, formulation of the objectives of the study and the hypotheses/ investigating questions.
4. Operationalization of concepts: definition of concepts, construction of indexes/ scales for measuring variables.

5. Preparation of the research plan: statement of the problem, objectives of the study, hypotheses,
   operational definition of the concepts, Geographical area of the study, methodology (type
   of research and methods of collection of data), sampling design, tools for collection of data,
   plan of analysis, over-view of the research report, time- schedule.

6. Construction of tools of data collection: identification of data needs, delineation of data
  sources, drafting observation schedule, interview schedule/ guide, mailed questionnaire and
  or check lists or experimental design, pre-testing and possible revision.

7. Collection of data: Experimental/ field work: ,preparing sample frame, drawing Sample of
   respondents; Interviewing them/ mailing questionnaires to them and follow up.

8. Processing of data: editing, coding, transcription, tabulation, construction of tables and charts.
9. Analysis of data: statistical treatment, testing hypotheses, interpretation of findings.

10. Report- writing: planning report- writing work, drafting the report and its finalization.

 The above steps or activities may be regrouped into the following three stages:
</p>

<h1>
1. Planning
</h1>

  <p>
	Selection of the problem

  Formulation of the selected problem

  Operationalization of concepts

  Preparation of the research design

  Planning report- writing work.

</h1>

<p>
	Drafting the report: Description of the research process; summary of findings, Suggestion for action and for further research.

   Finalization of the report

   Forward the report copies to the target audience / clients /users.

   All the above steps involved 1n a research process do not constitute a time order linear sequence.
There can be overlappings and recyclings depending on the nature of the study. Nevertheless one
should not fail to complete the sequence of steps required in scientific procedure.

increase  the number of publications: books and periodicals in developed and developing countries.
India and produces annually about 20,000 books.
</p>

<p>
	One  who is not fully conversant with what has gone before has little chance of making a
worth while contribution. Therefore a researcher has to survey the available literature relating to his
field of study He must keep himself update in his field and related areas.

<h1>
	           4.2 WHAT TO REVIEW AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE
</h1>

<h1>
Introduction
</h1>

<p>
	The review of literature is not mere reading for reading sake; it is also not a causal reading in
reading of a story or novel. It is focused and directed towards specific purposes. It is also selection
A researcher has to select the kinds of literature to be reviewed and determine the purposes for while
he has to study them. The literature review starts with the selection of a problem for research
continues through the various stages of the research process and ends with report writing.
</p>

<h1>
The Purposes of Review
</h1>

 <p>
   The reasons for review of related literature are:

   (1) to gain a background knowledge of the research topic,

   (2) to identify the concepts relating to it, potential relationships between them and to formulas
       researchable hypotheses,

   (3) to identify appropriate methodology, research design, methods, of measuring concepts are techniques of analysis,‘

   (4) to identify data sources used by other researchers, and

   (5) to learn how others Structured their reports.
</p>

<p>
	The kinds of literature to be reviewed at the various stages of the research processes and the
specific purposes of the review are indicated below:
</p>

<h1>
                   	4. 3 LITERATURE SEARCH PROCEDURE
</h1>

 <p>
    The above table shows that a researcher has to review the various kinds of literature relating to
the field of study. How can he identify the related materials? This research procedure
involve a series of steps. The exact sequence will vary depending upon the subject and the knowl-edges of the  researcher. A general approach is suggested below:
</p>

<p>
 1. Request learned professors, librarians or others familiar with the field to suggest relevant references.

 2. Find out whether any bibliography already prepared on the subject 18 available 1n the library.
     See the Bibliographic index, if any, maintained in the library.

 3. Consult bibliographies in the theses on the topic and related topics.

 4. See the card catalogues of the library: (1) Author catalogue cards if the authors of books
     are known; (2) Subject catalogue cards to locate the titles and other details of the books on the subject.

 5. Examine periodicals, monOgraphs, reports and conference proceedings and other materials
     including microfilms available in the library.

 6. Consult reference cited 1n the books and articles already located. Each book or article will be a means for locating additional references.

 7. Consult the abstract Journal on the subject or ‘Abstracts’ section in the journals relating to the subject.

 8. See the ‘Book— Review’ pages in the daily newspapers and in the journals.

(note: Prepare a source (or bibliography) card1 for each item of references located).

	               4.5 PLANNING THE REVIEW WORK
</h1>

<h1>
Proper Planning
</h1>

<p>
	Gathering and noting information from printed sources is often considered as a simple task and
taken for granted. But it is done poorly, when it is not planned properly.
</p>

<h1>
    Steps
</h1>

  <p>
	 This planning invOlves three steps:
</p>

  <p>
	1. To decide what information is useful and what is not useful: This decision is not easy to
make. The right approach is to identify the information needs of the research on hand. The research
should draw up a preliminary outline of the topic with reference to the objectives of study. Even
though this outline will change as he gathers more information, it serves as a guide for making the above decision.
</p>

<p>
	2. To determine how to record what is gathered from a published material: Should it
be noted down verbatim, outlined or paraphrased? New ideas, viewpoints, findings of earlier studies are arguments may be outlined in our work.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00079">79</pagenum>

<h1>
	   page no:79
</h1>

<p>
	Important definitions or statements to be quoted may be recorded verbatim within inverted commas.
</p>

<p>
   In a few instances, a paraphrase statement of the author’s position may be desirable.
</p>

<p>
  3. To Set up an orderly recording or note- taking system: Can bounded notebooks, loose
sheets or cards be used for recording notes taken from references consulted?

  In this decision, the researcher must be guided by the requirements of a good recording system.
These requirements are:
</p>

<p>
	1. The recording system should facilitate ready location of the recorded information when required.


2. It should allow for more flexible handling and organizing of information. That is, it should
   permit easy arrangement and re-arrangement, which is a matter of great importance for the classification and analysis Of information while drafting the report.

3. All notes relating to a particular concept or aspect of a topic should be available together.
</p>

  <p>
	Does traditional method of recording information in a bounded note book meet the above
requirements?  No. It does not facilitate ready reference, as one has to thumb every page, every time,
resulting in an awful waste of time and energy. It does not provide flexibility in organizing information i. e.,
it does not permit arrangement or rearrangement or information. Further, all the information
relating to a particular sub- title are not available in one place in the note book Thus, the system of
recording information in a bounded note-book does not satisfy any of the requirements of a good recording system
</p>.

<p>
	Even the system of loose sheets is not very much suitable. Sheets will get mutilated when
handled frequently. They also do not provide much flexibility in organizing the information.
</p>

<p>
	The most suitable method of recording notes is card system. It meets all the requirements of a
good recording system. Cards are tougher and will withstand handling. They are compact. They can
be easily  handled. They can be stored conveniently in boxes. They promote maximum flexibility in
arranging, re-arranging, grouping and classifying information. The use of cards is explained in the next section 4.6.
</p>

<h1>
	                   4.6 NOTE TAKING
</h1>

<h1>
	Introduction
</h1>

<p>
	The most suitable method of note taking, as explained earlier, is use of cards and a tentative
outline of the key elements regarding the topic. Though the outline may undergo revision when the
research acquires further insight into his subject, it is useful in deciding which information is needed
and how various bits of information should be related.
</p>

<p>
	 The recording system involves use of two sets of cards. One set of cards (3” x 5” cards), known
as source cards, is used for noting bibliographic information, and the second set (5”x 8” cards),
Known as note cards, is used for actual note —taking.
</p>

<h1>
Source Cards
</h1>

<p>
	The recording of bibliographic information in the source cards should be made in proper bib-liographic format. The following formats may be used:
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00080">80</pagenum>



<h1>
For a Book, page no:80
</h1>

   <p>
    	Author’s name (starting with last name), the title of the book, place of publication: the publishers name, year or

   Author’s name, the title of the book, the publisher’s name, place, year.

   Where a work has three or more authors, the abbreviation “et al”. meaning “and other” ,may
be used after the name of the first author, e.g., Koontz, Harold, et al., Management, New Delhi
McGraw- Hill International Book Company, 1980 or

    Kootz, Harold, et al., Management, McGraw- Hill International Book Company, New Delhi
1980. If a publication is an edited one, use the abbreviation “ed.” after the name.
</p>

<h1>
For an Article
</h1>

  <p>
	 Author’s name, “the title of the article”. The journal’s name, place. Publisher’s name, was Issues No., date, pages or

   Author’s name, “the title of the article”. The journal’s name, Publisher’s name, place, was Issues No., date, pages or

   For each reference (a book or an article or a report) taken up for reading, a separate card should be  used. One side only should be used.

   Source cards serve two purposes: First, they provide documentary information for footnotes
be given in the report. Second, they are used for compiling bibliography to be furnished at the end of the report.

  Source cards can be coded by a simple system in order to relate them to the corresponding no of cards. One useful coding system is;

   On the left hand top corner, the letter ‘B’ or ‘J’ or ‘R’ (B = Books, J = Journal, R =Report)
may be marked according to the type of reference which a card represents. This marking facilities
classification of cards into three categories: (1) Books reference cards (2) Cards relating to Article
and (3) Cards relating to Reports for compiling bibliography. When bibliography is compiled, source
cards can be classified into these three groups, and cards in each group can be arranged in the alphabetical order of the authors and this bibliography can be typed.

   Another code is to employ a combination of letter and number on the right- hand begins was
'C' . The same code has to be marked on the corresponding notes card to facilitate ready source reference for each note.

Illustrates source cards, The source cards can be preserved either 1n an Index box or hardboard box of suitable size.
</p>

<h1>
Note Cards
</h1>

   <p>
	Information extracted from a printed source is recorded on the note cards. It is desirable to an a single fact or idea on each card. This promotes maximum flexibility. One side only should be use.

   The following format may be adopted for achieving maximum flexibility:

  On the left- hand top corner the source reference code may be marked, and on the right   -hand
 corner the number of the researcher’s proposed chapter to which the information is related may be entered.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00081">81</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no :81
</h1>


<p>
	on the space between the top edge and the first horizontal line, the title of the broad theme, e. g..,
‘corporate planing’; or ‘capital budgeting’ or ‘demand analysis’ may be written, and in the next
space the title of the specific idea or fact, e. g. ., ‘definition of planning’ or ‘meaning of capital
budgeting’  ‘elasticity of demand’ may be written.
</p>

<p>
	In the body of the card, first, the name of the author and the title of the book/ article may be
noted in order to avoid making any mistake in identifying the {Concerned source card.
</p>

<p>
	Then the idea or fact extracted from the concerned reference is recorded. The number of the
page of the  source from which the above idea/ fact has been- extracted is noted on the left- hand margin of the card.
</p>

<p>
   The page number has to be quoted in the footnote Statement for the idea in the report.
</p>

<p>
	The above system of note -taking will enable a researcher “to develop a substantial set of notes,
	readily  into new patterns of organization, and with each idea reference back to its source. ”2
It facilities arranging the notes appropriately for drafting the report.
</p>

<p>
	 Note cards may be preserved 1n a card index box as they may be useful for related researches or for  articles.

	                     5.1 THE PLANNING PROCESS
</h1>

<h1>
Introduction
</h1>

<p>
	Research is an organized endeavour. Like any other organized work, research requires proper
planning. Planning means deciding in advance. Planning of research means deciding the question or
issue to be studied, setting the objectives of the study and determining the means of achieving those
objectives. It is an intellectual process. It requires intellectual curiosity, intelligence, imagination and
vision, and knowledge of methodology of research. Planning systematizes the research work. In
eliminates aimless intellectual wandering. It gives direction to the work.
</p>

<h1>
Planning Process
</h1>
<p>
	The planning stage of a research project involves the following steps:

1. Selection of a problem for research: This involves identification of a few problems and
selecting on out of them, after evaluating the alternatives against certain selection criteria.

2. Formulation of the selected problem: The selected problem is defined and transformed into researchable questions.

3. Formulation of hypotheses: The propositions to be tested are set up.

4. Conceptualization: The concepts associated with the problem under study are operationally
defined and measurement devices are designed.
5. Research plan or design: This plan covers all the aspects of the selected research work and serve as a blue-print for the endeavour.

All these aspects of research planning are discussed in detail in the following sections.

<h1>
	     PLANNING OF RESEARCH, page no:83
</h1>

<h1>
	           5.2 SELECTION OF A PROBLEM FOR RESEARCH
</h1>

<h1>
 Introduction
</h1>

 <p>
	The selection of a problem is the first step in research. The term ”problem means a question
or issue to be examined. The selection of a problem for research is not an easy task; itself is a
problem. It is least amenable to formal methodological treatment. Vision, an imaginative insight, plays an important  role in this process.
</p>

 <p>
	 This problem of selection arises when a student has to undertake research as a part of his course
requirement. In some universities a project study as prescribed as a requirement for even undergraduate
programmes. In several universities a project study is a partial requirement of postgraduate programmes
like M. com ., .,.M B. A., M. S. W, etc. Research is an important requirement of M. Phil. and of Doctoral degree programmes.
</p>

 <p>
	 In each of these cases, a student has to select a problem for his research.
</p>

<p>
	 Similarly, faculty members of colleges and universities select problems for research as an
academic pursuit. In case of projects sponsored by planning bodies, departments of government,
industries or other organizations, the sponsors themselves invariably suggest the problems to be studied.
</p>

 <p>
	 The nature of the problem to be selected depends upon the level at which the research is done.
A problem appropriate for undergraduate/ master degree students will necessarily be a modest one.
The emphasis  is upon the learning process of a beginner. A problem to be selected for M. Phil. /Ph. D.
programme must be a major problem requiring comprehensive treatment. In this case, the emphasis
upon both skill development and contribution to knowledge.
</p>

 <p>
	on the other hand, a problem to be selected by an experienced academic researcher must be a
complex problem meant for making a significant contribution to the development or refinement of theory or to policy making.
</p>

<h1>
The Mode of Selection
</h1>

<p>
	The students who undertake research as a course requirement do their research work under the
guidance a professor. What should be the mode of selection in their cases? Should a problem be suggested  by the guide or be selected by the researcher himself?
</p>

<p>
	A beginner in research may, of course, prefer the first choice. He will be happy if the problem
is suggested by the guide, for his problem of selection is easily solved. But is such suggestion appropriate?

</p>

 <p>
	 The suggestion of the problem by the guide means an imposition. It is an attempt to get some
Work done  rather than to train the student to do research on his own. It destroys spontaneity. The
problem  suggested by the guide may not be a topic in which the student is  really interested. Then he
may not find pleasure in studying it, and the study will become an unwanted burden to him. Therefore,
it is better to choose the problem oneself. Of course, the guide can help the candidate to help himself.
He may dig out the candidate’s area of interest and show him the way. The actual selection should be choice  of the candidate himself.
</p>

 <p>
	 One with a critical, curious and imaginative mind and is sensitive to practical problems could easily identify problems for study.
</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00084">84</pagenum>


 <h1>
Sources of Problems, page no:84
</h1>

<p>
 The sources from which one may be able to identify research problems or develop problem
awareness are:
</p>

<p>
1. Reading: When we critically study books and articles relating to the subject of our interest.
pertinent questions may arise in our mind. Similarly, areas of research may strike to our mind when we read research reports.


2. Academic experience: Classroom lectures, class discussions, seminar discussions and out-
of- class exchanges of ideas with fellow students and professors will suggest many stimulating problems to be studied.

3. Daily experience: Life is dynamic. We learn new things and undergo new experiences
every day. If we are alert, inquisitive and sensitive to life situations, we may hit upon
questions worth of investigation, “It IS a mark of scientific genius to be sensitive to difficulties
where less gifted people pass untroubled by doubts.”1

The story about Newton justifies to this. Though apples might have fallen on the head of
people before Newton’s time, only the sensitive Newton applied his mind on this event which led to the discovery of “Law of Gravitation”.

4. Exposure to field situations: Field visits, internship training and extension work provide exposure to practical problems which call for study.

5. Consultations: Discussions with experts, researchers administrators and business executives will help a researcher to identify meaningful problems for research.

6. Brain storming: Intensified discussion within a group of interested persons may often be
a means of identifying pertinent questions, and of developing new ideas about a problem.2

7. Research: Research on one problem may suggest problems for further research.

8. Intuition: Sometimes new ideas may strike to one’s mind like a ﬂash. Reflective 1mind is a  spring of knowledge.
</p>

<h1>
Process of Identification
</h1>

<p>
	The process of identification of problems for academic research may consist of the following steps:
</p>

<p>
	1. Selection of the discipline: The discipline or subject 1n which one proposes to do research
may be selected, e. g, Economics, Commerce, Management, Technology, Psychology etc. The selection
of the discipline is easy. One can select any subject, which one has studied thoroughly and which has
interested him most. Where one has to do research in his field of specialization   (e. g, Marketing
Management or Finance Management or Personnel Management in MBA. Programme), one 5
choose the subject of one’ s specialization.
</p>

<p>
	2. Demarcating the broad area or a particular aspect of the selected subject: The second
step is to Select a particular aspect of the selected subject. For example, if the selected subject is
Financial Management, then one may select capital budgeting, financial leverage, working capital management or profit management as specific area of study.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00085">85</pagenum>



<h1>
	                     PLANNING OF RESEARCH, page no:85
</h1>

<p>
	One who says that one is willing to do research on any aspect of discipline does not mean business does not know oneself.
</p>

<p>
	One should identify his specific area of interest. Interest in a particular area of a subject
develops educational background reading a good book or inspiration received from a professor.
</p>

<p>
	3. Identifying two or more specific topics in the selected broad area: This is the final step
in identification of problem. This requires a grasp of the branch of the subject as a whole and
awareness  of work already done on it. A review of concerned literature including research theses and
survey of research published by the Research Councils like Indian Council of Social Science Research,
New Delhi. intensive, reading and reflective thinking, and discussion with the guide will help a student
in identifying  specific topics or issues for research. Both an uncharted path and a well- trodden path
are dangerous to a beginner in research. If he chooses an unexplored problem, he has to grope in the
dark and may get frustrated. On the other hand, if he selects a problem, which has already been
thoroughly studied, he may not learn anything new nor contribute anything to the knowledge. It is
describe for him to adopt a via media approach. He may identify problems on which he can get the guidance of a few articles or books.
</p>

<p>
	A student cannot just select anyone of the identified problems for his research. He has to
evaluate  them for choosing the most appropriate one. How can this evaluation be done? Against what crteria?
</p>

<h1>
  Criteria of Selection
</h1>

<p>
	The selection of one appropriate researchable problem out of the identified problems requires
evaluation  of those alternatives against certain criteria. These criteria may be grouped into:

 (a) Internal (or personal) criteria or factors, and

  (b) External criteria or factors.
</p>

<p>
	Internal criteria consist of (1) researcher’ s interest, (2) researcher’ s competence, and
(3)researcher's own resource: finance and time.
</p>

<p>
	External factors include (1) researchability of the problem, (2) its importance and urgency,
(3) novelty of the problem, (4) feasibility, (5) facilities, (6) usefulness and social relevance, and
(7)Research personnel.
</p>

<p>
	Researcher's interest: The problem should interest the researcher and be a challenge to him.
without interest and curiosity, he may not develop sustained perseverance. Even a small difficulty may become an excuse for discontinuing the study.
</p>

Insert in a problem depends upon the researcher’s educational background, experience outlook and  sensitivity.

<p>
	Researcher's competence: A mere interest in a problem will not do. The researcher must be
competent to plan and carry out a study of the problem. He must have the ability to grasp and deal with it.
He must possess adequate knowledge of the subject matter, relevant methodology and statistical procedures.
</p>


<p>
	Researcher’s own resources: In the case of a research to be done by a researcher on his own,
consideration of his own financial resource is pertinent. Does the cost involved in conducting the
study of the problem is within the means of the researcher? If it is beyond his means, he will not be
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00086">86</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:86
</h1>

<p>
	able to complete the work, unless he gets some external financial support. Time resource is more
important than finance. Research is a time consuming process. What is the time that the researcher
can be able to spare for the research work? Is it adequate to meet the time requirements of the
problem? If not, the work cannot be completed within the prescribed time limit. As it is difficult to
foresee the eventual time constraint, it is desirable to over-estimate the time requirement and to
under-estimate the time availability. In this connection, available tidbits of time (say 5 or 10 minutes
at a time) should not be counted, as nothing could be done 1n 5 or 10 minutes, only large chunks of time available should be counted.
</p>

<p>
	Research ability: The problem should be researchable, i. e., amenable for finding answers to the
questions involved in it through scientific method. “Although every problem in science involves a
question or a series of questions, not every question qualifies as a scientific problem”3 To be researchable
a question must be one for which observation or other data collection in the real world can provide
the answer. Many questions cannot be answered on the basis of information alone. They may involve
value elements, e. g., what is merit for the purpose of employee promotion? What is ‘fairness’ to the
workers? Some questions may not be researchable because procedures or techniques are inadequate
e g., how will a new fiscal policy affect distributive justice? Which new management trainees
potential for top management?
</p>

<p>
	Importance and urgency: Problems requiring investigation are unlimited, but available research
efforts are very much limited. Therefore in selecting problems for research, their relative importance
and significance should be considered. An important and urgent problem should be given priority over
an unimportant one. For example, in industrial management today, problems of productivity, capacity
utilization, motivation and industrial unrest are more important than problems of financial leverage
profit planning, vertical /horizontal integration, marketing etc. Research must be focused on useful and urgent problems.
</p>

<p>
	Novelty or originality: The problem must have novelty. There 1s no use of wasting one’ s time
and energy on a problem already studied thoroughly by others.’
</p>

<p>
	This does not mean that replication is always needless. In social sciences in some cases, it  is  appropriate to replicate (repeat) a study in order to verify the validity of its findings to a difference situation.
</p>

<p>
	Feasibility. A problem may be a new one and also important, but if research on it is not feasible it cannot be selected. Hence feasibility is a very important consideration.
</p>

<p>
	Some of the questions that should be considered in examining the feasibility are:
</p>

’<p>
      Are suitable research techniques such as measurement devices and techniques of analysis
available?

     Are accurate and reliable data available? The reliability of the findings depends upon the
quality of data. In some cases, available data may be tinged by emotions. Ethnic conflicts
strikes and lockouts, poverty and affluence are examples of topics heavily weighted by
emotions.

     Will the authorities of the concerned institutions extend the required cooperation in furnishing data or permit access to records? Some organizations like Commercial banks, sole proprietary
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00087">87</pagenum>

	    page no:87
</h1>


<p>
	and  partnership concerns and private limited companies do not easily extend cooperation to
researchers.
</p>

   <p>
   Will the respondents be willing to be interviewed?

   Can the study be completed within the time available?

On the basis of the consideration of the above questions, the feasibility of the problem should
be determined.
</p>

  <p>
	 Facilities: Research requires certain facilities such as well— equipped library facility, suitable and
competent guidance, data processing facility, etc. Hence, the availability of the facilities relevant to the problem must be considered.
</p>

    <p>
	Usefulness and social relevance: Above all, the study of the problem should make significant
contribution  to the concerned body of knowledge or to the solution of some significant practical
problem. It  should be socially relevant. This consideration is particularly important in the case of higher- level  academic research and sponsored research.
</p>

<p>
	Research personnel: Research undertaken by professors and by research organizations require
the service  of investigators and research officers. But in India and other developing countries,
research has not yet become a prospective profession. Hence, talented persons are not attracted to
research projects. Employment in research projects is just considered as a stop- gap arrangement
pending securing a regular placement. Therefore appropriate qualified and experienced research
personnel  are not easily available for the study of some problems.
</p>

   <p>
	Conclusion: Each identified problem must be evaluated in terms of the above internal and
external criteria and the most appropriate one may be selected by a research scholar. The overall
guide line to be followed in this selection process is:
</p>

   <p>
	Select a feasible and researchable problem which is  interesting to you and within your competence
and manageable within the available time and resources, and at the time same time has some importance
and social relevance, and for. which required facilities are available.

	                5.3 FORMULATION or THE SELECTED PROBLEM
</h1>

<h1>
Introduction
</h1>
<p>

The  problem selected for research may initially be vague. The question to be studied or the
problem be solved may not be clear. Why the answer/ solution is wanted also may not be known.
Hence, the selected problem should be defined and formulated. This is a difficult process. It requires
intensive reading of a few selected articles or chapters in books in order to understand the nature of
the selected problem. The reading at this stage should be focused on the ‘classics’ and research
papers on  the topic. Gunnar Myrdal’s The Challenge of World Poverty in the study of anti—poverty programmes, Peter F. Drucker’ s The Effective Executive in the study of managerial effectiveness,
Harold's paper on Dynamic theory in Growth Economics are a few examples of classics. The researcher
should read such selected literatures, digest, think and reflect upon what is read and digested. He should also discuss with learned persons.
</p>

<p>
	Then only can he gain insight into the chosen problem and be able to define and formulate it.
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00088">88</pagenum>

<h1>
	    page no:88
</h1>

<p>
	What is Formulation?

     Formulation means translating and transforming the selected research problem/ topic into a
scientifically researchable question.4 it is concerned with specifying exactly what the research problems is and why is it studied. The formulation should include both the what and the why aspects.

    Merton5 identifies three principal components in the progressive formulation of a problem
research:

l. The originating question (what one wants to know?)
2. The rationale (Why aspects)
3. The specifying questions (possible answers to the originating questions).
</p>

<p>
	The originating question It indicates what the problem is. It may be of different kinds. It may
call for discovering new and more decisive facts relating to the subject- matter of study; it may per
to question the adequacy of certain concepts, may be related to empirical validity, or it may be realted to the structure of an organization.
</p>

<p>
	 Rationale of the question: Rationale is the statement of reasons why a particular question is
posed. It states how the answer to the question will contribute to theory and /or practice. The
rationale helps to make a discrimination between scientifically important and trivial question. In short it “states the case for the question in the court of scientific opinion. ”6
</p>

<p>
	Specifying question: The originating question is decomposed into several specific question
order to identify the observations /data that will provide answer to them. These speciFIc question
should be simple, pointed, clear and empirically verifiable. They are known as ‘investigative’ questions
It is only such specific questions which when synthesized can afford the solution to the problem
selected for research. This solution has implications for theory/ systematic knowledge and /or for
practice.
</p>

<h1>
 Formulation Process
</h1>
<p>
	The process of formulation involves the following steps:
</p>

<p>
	1. Developing title: The title should be carefully worded. It should indicate the core of the
study, reflect the real intention of the researcher, and show on what is the focus e. g., “Financing
small- scale industries. by commercial banks.” This shows that the focus is on commercials banks and
not on small- scale industries. On the other hand, if the title is “the Financial Problem of Small- scale
industries”, the focus is on small- scale industries. The title may also indicate the geographical area of the study.
</p>

<p>
	2. Building a conceptual model: On the basis of our theoretical knowledge of the phenomena
under study, the nature of the phenomenon, its properties /elements and their inter-relations Should
be identified and structured into a framework. This conceptual model gives an exact idea of the
research problem and shows its various properties and variables to be studied. It serves as a basis for
the formulation of the objectives of the study and the hypotheses to be tested. In order to work out a conceptual model we must make a careful and critical study of the available literature on the
</p>

</h1>


<p>
 subject -matter of the selected research problem. It is for this reason, a research student is expected
to select a problem  for research in his field of specialization Without adequate background knowledge,
a researcher  not grasp and comprehend the nature of the research problem.

    The following example7 will illustrate the process of developing a conceptual model.
</p>

<p>
	Conceptual model for a study of profitability of a commercial bank: Profit is the difference
between income and expenditure. A commercial bank’s main source of income is interest earned on
loans and advances It also derives some non- interest income in the form of commission, service
changes, etc. Its major expenditure 13 interest paid on deposits; it incurs manpower and other expenses
for providing services to the customers. What are the inter—relationships between these elements? (See Exh. 5.1).
</p>

<p>
	The difference between interest earned and interest paid may be called “Spread’5 and the
difference  between the Spread and the Burden determines the net profit (or loss). By identifying the factors in influence Spread and Burden an approach for profit management can be developed.8
</p>

                       The Profitability of a Commercial Bank
</h1>

<p>
3. defining the objective of the study: The objectives refer to the questions to be answered
through the study. They indicate what we are trying to get from the study.
</p>

 <p>
	The objectives are derived from the conceptual model. They state which elements in the conceptual
model- which  levels of, which kinds of cases, which properties, and which connections among
properties -are to be investigated, but it is the conceptual model that defines, describes, and states
the assumption  underlying these elements.9
</p>

<p>
	The objectives way aim at description or explanation or analysis of causal relationship between
	variables indicate the expected results or outcome of the study.
</p>

<p>
The objectives  may be specified in the form of either statements or questions.
</p>

<p>
	Illustration: The profitability of commercial banks tends to decline year after: year, even though
the volumes of business — deposits and deployment of funds —— is on the increase. How will a
research formulate a problem when he encounters this situation?
</p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page00090">90</pagenum>


<h1>
	     page no:90
</h1>


<p>
	(1) Title of the research problem. “An enquiry into the declining trend 1n the profitability
commercial bank.”

(2) Objectives of the Study: In a Statement form:
</p>

<p>
The objectives of the study are:
    (a) to identify the major factors affecting the bank’s profitability
    (b) to determine the major causes of the declining trend in its profitability, and
    (c) to develop a strategy for improving the bank’s profitability.
The above objectives may be stated in question form as under:
The study aims at seeking answers to the following questions:
(a) What are the major factors affecting the bank’s profitability?
(b) What are the major causes of the declining trend in its profitability?
(c) What strategy can be adopted for improving the bank’s profitability?
    The successful research will provide answers to these questions.
</p>

<p>
	4. Setting investigative questions: Once the objectives of the research/ or the general research
questions have been defined, the formulation moves to the next level, i. e., investigative question
These sub-questions are set up for each of the major research objectives/ questions. These speech
questions guide the details of the research efforts, including the development of concepts, operational
definitions and measurement devices. There may be several sub- levels of the inVestigative question each being progressively narrower in scope and more specific.
</p>

<p>
	Example. The investigative questions relating to the first objective of the previous
(Factors affecting a commercial bank’s profitability) are:

A. What are the factors affecting interest earned on advances?
(l) Has the proportion of the total earning assets to deposits tended to decline?
(2) What is the composition of earning assets?
(3) What is the rate of yield on each type of asset?

B. What are the factors affecting interest paid on deposits and borrowings?
(1) Have the interest paying liabilities tended to increase?
(2) What is the composition of interest paying liabilities?
(3) What is the rate of interest on each component?

C. What are the factors affecting manpower expenses?
(1) Has the number of employees tended to increase?
(2) What are the seniority and composition of employees?
(3) What is the salary structure?
    and so on.
</p>

<p>
	5. Formulation of hypotheses: The hypotheses are tentative propositions relating to investigation questions. We formulate them to be tested in our research. They either describe the properties.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00091">91</pagenum>

<h1>
	     page no:91
</h1>

<p>
variables  or show the relationships between them. They aim at answering the research questions.
They determine what facts will be sought and what research procedures will be used. For detailed
discussion of hypotheses, see topic 5.4, below.
</p>

<p>
	6. Operational definition of concepts: The next step in the formulation process is to define
operationally the  concepts involved in the title, objectives, investigative questions and hypotheses.
The operational definitions specify the measurement parameters of the variables. Scales/indices are constructed for measuring abstract concepts.
</p>

<p>
  The operational definitions of concepts and measurement devices enable us to decide exactly the
data needs of the research. The operational definition of concepts is explained 1n detail in topic 5.5, below.
</p>

<p>
	7. Delimiting the scope of the study: This means demarcation of the scope and dimensions
of the study. A complete study of any phenomenon is well- nigh un-manageable. It would entail such
an overwhelmingly large volume of data that it would require more than a student’s life time to gain a glimpse of the phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
	A beginner is especially over-ambitious. He is tempted to cover too wide a scope without
Knowing its complexities. For example, a student may propose to study the problem of unemployment
in his state for his final term project. Can it be possible to complete this study on his own within a
period of 3 months?  The problem is complex and it is related to various categories of occupational

groups. its covers several aspects. extent, causes, impacts and remedial measures. Data has to be
collected from government institutions and individuals. Even a sample survey may require a large
staff of field investigators. And so on.
</p>

<p>
	 Therefore, a research should take a close view of the implications and dimensions of the selected
problems and keep the scope of its study within manageable limits, i. e., within the ability of the mind
to grasp the implication and within the amount of time and other resources available.
</p>

<p>
	 The purpose of this delimitation 18 to avoid confusion and superficiality and promote clarification.
and successful completion within time limits and available resources.
</p>

<p>
    The various aspects that may be delimited are:

 (1) the objectives of the study, i. e., the number and extent of questions to be investigated:

 (2) the geographical area to be covered by the study, say, a state, a district, a taluka, a city or a village:

 (3) reference period; and

 (4) the magnitude of the study; the universe to be covered; the types of sampling units to be
    studied; and the sample size.

   The  delimitation can be done from the standpoint of:

  (1) aims and interests of the research worker or the sponsor, as the case may be,

  (2) availability of relevant information,

  (3) complexity of theoretical basis of the study,

  (4)the extent and scope of previous research done in the field,

  (5) the amount of finance, and time available, and

  (6) the quantity and extent of personnel, tools, techniques and other facilities available.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00092">92</pagenum>

<h1>
	    page no:92
</h1>

<p>
	The consideration of all these factors is to bring down the scope and dimensions of the state
to a manageable level and yet to make it useful and meaningful.
</p>

<h1>
	Importance of Formulation
</h1>

<p>
	‘A problem well put is half- solved’. This saying highlights the importance of proper formula
of the selected problem. The primary task of research is collection of relevant data and the analysis
of data for finding answers to the research questions. The proper performance of this task depends
upon the identification of exact data and information required for the study. The formulation set
this purpose. The clear and accurate statement of the problem, the development of the Conceptual
model, the definition of the objectives of the study, the setting of investigative questions, the formula
of hypotheses to be tested and the operational definition of concepts and the delimitation of the
determine the exact data needs of the study. Once the exact data requirement is known, the research
can plan and execute the other steps without any waste of time and energy. Thus, formulation give
a direction and a specific focus to the research effort. It helps to delimit the field of enquiary
singling out the pertinent facts from a vast ocean of facts and thus saves the researcher from become
lost in a welter of irrelevancies. The determination of exact information needs through the formula
process prevents a blind search and indiscriminate gathering of data, which my later prove irrelevant
to the problem under study. The hypotheses to be tested determine the appropriate statistical techniques
to be adopted for analysis. Thus all the major tasks — sampling, selecting appropriate  methods
collection of data, construction of tools for data collection, designing plan of analysis- can
planned exactly without any waste of efforts. Hence, the saying ‘a problem well put is half- solve
is true.
</p>


<p>
	Researchers who do not define and formulate their research problems read and collect vast
and build up massive files without knowing which is relevant and which is not relevant and are to
lost in an aimless empirical wandering. Even after spending several months and sometimes even
years, they do not get a specific direction. No wonder such researchers invariably get frustrated a discontinue their research work. Research guides have a great responsibility in helping their research scholars in making a clearcut formulation of their research problems and save them from frustration.

	                           5.4 HYPOTHESES
</h1>

<h1>
	Introduction
</h1>

<p>

    The formulation of hypotheses or propositions as to the possible answers to the research question
is an important step in the process of formulation of the research problem as explained in the previous
Section (5.3). Keen observation, creative thinking, hunch, wit, imagination, vision, insight and social-
judgement are of greater importance in setting up reasonable hypotheses. 10 A thorough knowledge
about the phenomenon and related fields is of great value in its process. The formulation of hypothesis plays an important part in the growth of knoWledge in every science.
</p>

<h1>
 Meaning of Hypothesis
</h1>

<p>
	Hypothesis is a tentative proposition formulated for empirical testing It is a declarative statement
combining concepts. It is a tentative answer to a research question. It is tentative, because its various
</p>

 <p>
	can be evaluated only after it has been tested empirically. Lundberg defines hypothesis as “a tentative
generalization validity of which remains to be tested.”11 Goode and Hatt define it as “a proposition which can be put to a test to determine its validity.”12
</p>

<h1>
 Hypothesis -Necessary or Not
</h1>

<p>
	 Is  the formulation of useful hypotheses always necessary and possible? It is true that hypotheses
are useful and they guide the research process in the proper direction. But can hypothesis be set up
in all cases? mere fact- finding investigations, no problems may be raised and the need for formulating
hypothesis may not arise. Similarly, in exploratory studies, initially it may not be possible to set up
any worth while hypotheses. In fact, the very purpose of such exploratory studies may be to formulate
meaningful hypothesis  for further formal studies. But strictly speaking, the mere fact- finding and the
exploratory studies cannot be considered to be typical research studies. In all analytical and experimental studies, hypotheses should be set up in order to give a proper direction to them.
</p>

<h1>
	Types of Hypotheses
</h1>

<p>
	Hypothesis are classified in several ways. With reference to their function, hypotheses are of
two types: (a) Descriptive Hypotheses- and (b) Relational Hypotheses. Another approach is to classify
them into: (c) Working Hypotheses, (d) Null Hypotheses and (e) Statistical Hypotheses. Third approach
is to divide them on the basis of the level of abstraction. Three broad levels may be distinguished:
(i) simple description, (ii) logical derivation, and (iii) abstraction. Accordingly there are three types of hypothesis: (f) common-sense hypotheses, (g) complex hypotheses and (h) analytical  hypotheses.
</p>

<p>
	Descriptive hypotheses: These are propositions that describe the characteristics (such as size, form or distribution) of a variable. The variable may be an object, person, organization, situation or
event. Some Examples are:

   "The rate of unemployment among arts graduates is higher than that of commerce graduates.”

    "Public enterprises are more amenable for centralized planning.”

   "The educational system is not oriented to human resource needs of a country.”
</p>

<p>
	Relational hypotheses: These are propositions, which describe the relationship between two
variables. The relationship suggested may be positive or negative correlation or causal relationship.
Some examples are:

   "Families with higher incomes spend more for recreation.”

   "participative management promotes motivation among executives.”

   "The lower the rate of job turnover in a work group, the higher the work productivity.”

   "Upper- class people have fewer children than lower -class people.”

  "Labour productivity decreases as working duration increases.”
</p>

<p>
   Casual hypotheses state that the existence of, or a change in, one variable causes or leads to
an effect on another variable. The first variable 18 called the independent variable, and the latter the
dependent variable When dealing with causal relationships between variables the researcher must
consider the direction in which such relationships ﬂow, i. e., which is cause and which is effect.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00094">94</pagenum>

<h1>
	    page no :94
</h1>

<p>
	Working hypotheses: While planning the study of a problem, hypotheses are formed. Initially
they may not be very specific. In such cases, they are referred to as “Working Hypothesis" who
are subject to modification as the investigation proceeds.
</p>

<p>
	Null hypotheses: These are hypothical statements denying what are explicitly indicated by
working hypotheses. They do not, nor were ever intended to exist in reality. They state that
difference exists between the‘ parameter and the statistic being compared to it. For example, even
though there is relationship between a family's income and expenditure on recreation, a null hypothesis
may state: “There is no relationship between families’ income level and expenditure on recreation
Null hypotheses are formulated for testing statistical significance, since, this form is a convert
approach to statistical analysis. As the test would nullify the null hypotheses, they are so called.
</p>

<p>
	There is  some justification for using null hypotheses. They conform to the qualities of declaration
and objectivity to be possessed by a researcher. The attempts to test hypothesis which he assumes
be true, it would appear as if he is not behaving objectively. This problem does not arise when
uses null hypotheses.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, null hypotheses are more exact. It is easier to reject the contrary of an hypothesis
 to confirm it with complete certainty. Hence, the conCept of null hypotheses is found to be as
useful.
</p>

<p>
	Statistical hypotheses: These are statements about a statistical population. These are derived
from a sample. These are quantitative in nature in that they are numerically measurable, e. g.,
A is older than Group B".
</p>

<p>
	Statistical hypotheses may be hypotheses of difference or hypotheses of association. The
specify the relations between variables. This association is measured by the Co-efficient of correlation
e. g., if the co-efficient of correlation between bonus and productivity is +1.0, then there is a prefer positive correlation between the bonus and productivity.
</p>

<p>
	As Abraham Kaplan has pointed out, ‘all inductive inference is based on samples...
hypotheses might be said to be statistical hypotheses in a broad sense: statistics has the task
assessing the weight of evidence for a particular hypothesis contained in a given set of data."23
</p>

<p>
	Common sense hypotheses: These represent the common sense ideas They state the existent
of empirical uniformities perceived through day to day observations. Many empirical uniformities
maybe observed in business establishments, the social background of workers, and the behaviour
patterns of specific groups like students, e. g., “-shop —assistants in small shops lack motivation."

“Soldiers from upper- class are less adjusted 1n the army than lower class men”, “Fresh studies
conform to the conventions set up by seniors."
</p>

<p>
	Common sense statements are often a confused mixture of cliches and moral judgments. scientist
have a large- scale job in transforming and teSting them. This requires three tasks: “first, the remove
of value judgement; second the clarification of terms: and third, the application of validity tests."
‘What everybody knows’ is not known until it has been tested’. The simple level hypotheses that
empirical generalization play an important role in the growth of a science.
</p>

<p>
	Complex hypotheses: These aim at testing the existence of logically derived relational
between empirical uniformities. For example, in the early stage Human ecology described empirical.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00095">95</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:95
</h1>

<p>
Uniformities in the distribution of land values, industrial concentrations, types of business and other
phenomena. Further study and logical analysis of these and other related findings led to the formulation
of complex hypothesis such as “The Concentric growth circles characterize a city”, “Members of
minority groups suffer from oppression psychosis”, etc. Such hypotheses are purposeful distortions
of empirical exactness. Because of their removal from empirical reality, these constructs are termed
as 'ideal types' The function of such hypotheses is to create tools and problems for further research
in otherwise very complex areas of investigation. ”15
</p>

<p>
	 analytical hypotheses: These are concerned/ with the relationship of analytic variables. These
hypothesis occur at the highest level of abstraction. These specify relationship between changes in
one property and changes in another. For example, the study of human fertility might show empirical
regularities by wealth, education, region, and religion. If these were raised to the level of ideal type
formulation, one result might be the hypotheses: “There are two high- fertility population segments in
India, viz., low -income urban Muslims and low- income rural low caste Hindus.” At a still higher level
of abstraction,  the effects of region, education, and religion on fertility might be held constant. This would allow a better measurement of the relation between the variables of wealth and fertility.

   This level of hypothesizing 1s the most sophisticated mode of formulation and contributes to the development ‘brilliant’ abstract theories.
</p>

<h1>
Sources of Hypotheses
</h1>

<p>
	Hypotheses can be derived from various sources.
</p>

<p>
	1.Theory: This is one of the main sources of hypotheses. It gives direction to research by
stating what is known. Logical deduction from theory leads to new hypotheses. For example, profit/ wealth maximization  is considered as the goal of private enterprises. From this assumption, various
hypotheses are  derived. “The rate of return on capital employed is an index of business success”; “The
optimum capital structure is that combination of debt and equity which leads to the maximum value
of the firm. “Higher the earning per share, more favourable is the financial leverage”.
</p>

<p>
	2. Observation: Hypotheses can be derived from observation. From the observation of price
behaviour in a market, for example, the relationship between the price and demand for an article
is hypothesized.
</p>

<p>
	3. Analogies are another source of useful hypotheses. Julian Huxley has pointed out that
casual
observation in nature or in the framework of another science may be a fertile source of hypotheses
. For example, the hypothesis that“ similar human types or activities may be found in similar
geophysical
regions" came from plant ecology.
</p>

<p>
	4. Institution and personal experience may also contribute to the formulation of hypotheses.
personal life and experiences of persons determine their perception and conception. These may, in
turn, direct a person to certain hypotheses more quickly. The story of Newton and the falling
apple, the flash of wisdom to Buddha under a Banyan tree illustrate this individual accidental process.
</p>

<p>
	5. Findings of studies. Hypotheses may be developed out of the findings of other studies in
order to  replicate and test.
</p>

<p>
   6. State of knowledge: An important source of hypotheses is the state of knowledge in any
particular science; Where formal theories exist, hypotheses can be deduced. If the hypotheses are"
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00096">96</pagenum>

	   page no: 96
</h1>
<p>
rejected, theories would be modified. Where formal theories are scarce, hypotheses are generated
from conceptual frameworks. In either case, the hypotheses are related to the conceptual- theoretical.
</p>

<p>
	7. Culture: Another source of hypotheses is the culture on which the researcher was
Western culture has induced the emergence of sociology as an academic discipline. Over the
decade, a large part of the hypotheses on American society examined by researchers were connection
with violence. This interest is related to the considerable increase in the level of violence in
America  In India in socio- economic and leadership studies, hypotheses based on caste and
economic status a common, because Indian society is caste- ridden, hierarchical and segmental,
and the Indian economic system is riddled with inequalities and privileges.
</p>

<p>
	8. Continuity of research: The continuity of research in a field itself constitutes an
important source of hypotheses. The rejection of some hypotheses leads to the formulation of new
ones caption of explaining dependent variables in subsequent researches on the same subject.
</p>

<h1>
	The Functions or the Role of Hypotheses
</h1>

<p>
	In social science research, a hypothesis serves several important functions.

1. A hypothesis gives a definite point to the investigation, and it guides the direction on the
study. Without a hypothesis, research becomes unfocussed, a random empirical  wandering
The researcher would get stranded in a cross road, not knowing the direction in which
proceed. A hypothesis, thus, directs our search for the order among facts.

2. A hypothesis speciﬁes the sources of data, which shall be studied, and 1n what context the
shall be studied.

3. It determines the data needs. It defines which facts are relevant and which are not. the unit
of hypothesis thus prevents a blind search and indiscriminate gathering of data, which
later found to be irrelevant to the problem under study.

4. A hypothesis suggests which type of research is likely to be most appropriate.

5. It determines the most appropriate technique of analysis.

6. A hypothesis contributes to the development of theory. It links theory and investigation
hypothesis may be deduced from theory. When it is tested through studies and found
it forms part of the theory.
</p>

<p>
	When a social scientist develops a theory to explain a phenomenon, he does not test them
directly. He tests the hypotheses derived from it. If the tests confirm the hypotheses, the theory
accepted. Thus, hypotheses make it possible to test theories.
</p>

<p>
	Occasionally, the reverse process takes place. Theory may be constructed from hypothesis
</p>

<p>
	The above point may be clear, if illustrated. Let us take the hypothesis: “Families with
higher income spend more on recreation.”
</p>

<p>
	This shows that families belonging to the various strata of the people in a place have to
studied and their family income and expenses have to be studied. What IS relevant is the total
income and proportion of expenses on recreation."
</p>

<p>
	As this hypothesis describes the relation between two variables, viz., income level and
recreated expenditure, it is clear that appropriate research design should be used for testing it.

	  what is a good hypothesis? What are the criteria for judging it? An acceptable hypothesis
should fulfill certain conditions.
</p>

<p>
	1.Conceptual clarity: A hypothesis should be conceptually clear. It should consist of clearly
defined and understandable concepts. Clarity is obtained by means of defining operationally
the concepts in the hypothesis. (The process of Operationalization is discussed 1n detail in
topic 5.5, below).
</p>

<p>
	2. Specificity: A hypothesis should be specific and explain the expected relations between
variables and the conditions under which these relations will hold, e. g., “when there is
dissatisfaction and no care is taken, deprivation will engender violence.”
</p>

<p>
	3. Testability: A hypothesis should be testable and should not be a moral judgement. It should
be possible to collect empirical evidences to test the hypothesis. Statements like‘ ‘capitalists
exploit their workers”/ “Bad partners produce bad children’ are common place generalization
and  cannot be tested, as they merely express sentiments and their concepts are vague.
</p>

<p>
	4. Availability of techniques: Hypotheses should be related to available techniques. Otherwise
they  will not be researchable; therefore the researcher must make sure that methods are
available for testing his proposed hypotheses.
</p>

<p>
	5. Theoretical relevance: A hypothesis should be related to a body of theory. A science can
be cumulative only by building on an existing body of facts and theory. It cannot develop
if each study 18 an isolated investigation. When research is systematically based upon a body
of existing theory, a genuine contribution to knowledge is more likely to result. Therefore,
a hypothesis should possess theoretical relevance.
</p>

<p>
	6. Consistency: Hypotheses should be logically consistent. Two or more propositions logically
derived from the same theory must not be mutually contradictory.
</p>

<p>
	7. Objectivity: Scientific hypotheses should be free from value — judgement. In principle, the
researcher’s system of values has no place in scientific method. However, as social phenomena
are affected by the milieu in which they take place, the researcher must be aware of his
values and state them explicitly.
</p>

<p>
	8. Simplicity: A hypothesis should be a simple one requiring fewer conditions or assumptions.
But ‘simple’ does not mean obvious. Simplicity demands insight. The more insight the
researcher has into a problem, the simpler will be his hypothesis about it.
</p>

<h1>
	Evaluating Hypothesis
</h1>

<p>
	  How can hypotheses be evaluated? Clover and Basley suggest the following checklist16 for
evaluating Hypotheses

 (1) Have all the pertinent area or aspects of the problem been considered in the process of
     setting up the hypotheses?

(2) DO the hypotheses include all the pertinent poSsibilities to answer the research questions?

(3) Have the hypotheses been selected on the basis of such possibilities?

	   page no:98
</h1>


<p>
 (4) Have the hypotheses been selected without fearing the possibility of their substantiability

 (5) Have the hypotheses been selected under conditions that allowed the researcher to set up
     all hypotheses having real bearing on the problem?
</p>

<p>
	The above questions are concerned with the coverage of hypotheses and conditions of their
selection.

   Robert Bales17 lists the following pertinent questions to be asked about hypotheses before
adopting them for investigation:
</p>

<p>
(1) Are the concepts used in hypotheses specific?

(2) Is the posited relationship between variables verifiable?

(3) Is there any prior evidence as to the truth or falseness of the posited relationship?

(4) Can an appropriate research design be devised?

(5) Are the variables ‘context -bound’ or applicable to other situations?

(6) Are the generalizations a part of a theoretical system?

  If the above sets of questions are answered satisfactorily, then the hypotheses can be
 considered reasonably logical and valid as guides for continuing the research process.
</p>

<h1>
	The Process of Setting Up Hypotheses
</h1>

<p>
	How can a researcher go about in setting up hypotheses for his research problem?
</p>

<p>
	Once the investigative questions are set up, as explained in Section 5.3, for each of the
objectives the researcher should identify the anticipated or possible- answers to the
investigative questions. A survey of related theories and earlier studies and discussions with
fellow scientists will facilitate this  process.
</p>

<p>
	This process “requires hunch, wit, imagination and method. It demands searching, delving,
trying, failing, and trying again and coming to a conclusion."18
</p>

<p>
	He, then, should write down those answers as appropriate types of hypotheses -- descriptive
relational or causal —— as the case may be.
</p>

<p>
	He should evaluate these tentative hypotheses in terms of the characteristics of a good
hypothesis and refine and record them into logical and testable hypotheses, keeping in mind the
rules given below.
</p>

<h1>
	Rules of Constructing Hypotheses
</h1>
<p>
	Smith19 suggests certain rules of constructing good hypotheses.
1. Search for variable measurements with the most quantitative characteristics available.

  Precise quantitative measurement is more critical 1n testing theory than qualitative characteristics,
Hage20 gives five techniques of searching for and creating variables out of non -variable concepts
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00099">99</pagenum>

<h1>
	    page no : 99
</h1>

   <p>
	First, the researcher can search for implied dimensions underlying non -variable concepts.
Campbell21 provides a good example for this method in studying the non— —variable concept ‘social
group. "He identifies four underlying dimensions of degrees of proximity, similarity, perceived
common fate, and perceived spatial pattern.
</p>

  <p>
	Second, one can create new variables by comparing conceptual synonyms or analogies. Price22
used the synonym technique in his study of organizational measurement; concepts like ‘
‘participation in decision making”, “organization control”, “power” and “influence” refer to the
degree of organizational centralization.
</p>

  <p>
	Third, one can search the, literature for rarely occurring associations between phenomena.
Cognitive finance theory in Sociology got its start in this manner.
</p>

 <p>
	Fourth, one can generate new variables through ordering many concepts from more to less abstract.
</p>

   <p>
	2. Make the variable scale properties explicit by stating all of the variable’s mutually exclusive
and totally inclusive categories by degree.
</p>

  <p>
	 For example, a variable like ‘income’ may be categorized as ( 1) upto Rs. 500 per month,
(2)Rs. 501 to 1,000 (3) Rs. 1,001 to 2, 000, (4) Rs. 2, 001 and above. Levels of bureaucratic
structure may be defined  by (1) 1 to 3 levels, (2) 4 to 10 levels, (3) 11 or more levels.
</p>

<p>
	3. Describe the means used to sort observation into your variable categories in sufficient detail
 so that your methods may be evaluated and replicated by others.

" Personality disintegration” is a good example of poorly operationalized variable. It is an
unreliable measure and cannot be replicated.

4. Always consider alternative operations, which might be more appropriate for a given variable.

5. Analyse variables through their relationships. Non- ratio one- variable distribution is arbitrary,
since it has no intrinsic lower boundary.

6. Link two or more formal propositions through a shared independent or dependent variable
whatever possible.
</p>

<p>
	For example, form the following concrete observations ——

1. Married persons are less likely than unmarried persons to commit suicide.

2. Married persons with children are less likely than married persons without children to
   commit suicide —

The following abstract formal hypotheses may be inductively produced:
1. Suicide rates vary directly with the degree of individualism.
2. Suicide rates vary indirectly with the degree of group cohesion.
</p>

<h1>
	Testing of Hypotheses
</h1>

 <p>
	Science does not admit anything as valid knowledge, until satisfactory tests confirm its validity
.Hypotheses are only hunches and provisional ideas. They should not be considered as facts,
however
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000100">100</pagenum>

<h1>

</h1>
<p>
	systematically they have been arrived at. They are just meant for “testing through the
researcher process. Only after thorough testing, they may be accepted or rejected What should be
the attitude the of the researcher in testing the hypotheses?
</p>

<p>
	The researcher should not start out, to‘ ‘prove” his hypotheses. He should ‘test’ them by
adopting appropriate scientific procedures and accept the negative or positive results in true
scientific spirit of inquiry. He should have an open mind, and with a spirit of disinterestedness
he should test them should not defend his hypotheses when facts prove the contrary. Hypotheses
should not become a vested interest.
</p>

<p>
	The process of testing hypotheses embodies the major part of the research process. It consist
of operationalization of the concepts, construction of data gathering tools, collection of data,
statistical If the facts analysis of data and drawing inferences from the results. Tests of
significance are applied. If the fact confirm the hypotheses, then the latter are tenable. Two
types of errors may occur while testing hypotheses. We may reject a hypothesis, which is true and
should not be rejected. Or we ma accept a hypothesis, which is false and should be rejected. These errors are called type I and type II errors respectively. Every care should be taken at
various stages of the study in order to avoid both type of errors.
</p>

<p>
	The statistical procedure of testing hypotheses is discussed in detail in Chapter 11.

	                            5.5 CONCEPTS
</h1>

<h1>
	Introduction
</h1>


<p>
	The title of the research problem, the objectives of the study, the investigative questions
and the hypotheses consist of concepts. Those concepts should be precisely defined. This is an
important step in the formulation of the research problem. It is the definitions of concepts that
determine the  information needs of the study. Therefore, precise definitions of concepts are
essential for planning the subsequent steps in the research process.
</p>

<h1>
	Definition
</h1>

<p>
	Each science attempts to investigate particular sections or aspects of reality, with an
abstract system of thought to interpret those segments. So it develops its own terms or concepts
for communicating its findings. For “example, ‘utility’ in Economics represents ‘the capacity
of a thing to satisfy a human want’; it has no ethical or moral significance; ‘responsibility’ in
management means ‘obligation’ of a subordinate to do the assigned job. A scientist abstracts
meanings out of  observed reality and attaches names to those meanings. Such names are concepts.
They are indicates by words or phrases.
</p>

<p>
 A concept is, thus, an abstract symbol representing an object, a property of an object or a
certain phenomenon, e. g., book, person, intelligence, and meeting. It is an abstraction from
sense impressive or percepts. A concept like ‘aggression’ or ‘frustration’ or ‘political
participation’ represents  a number  of events under one general name or label. Therefore, “a
concept is in reality a definition in short hand of a class or group of facts. ”23 “The purpose is to present in simplified form the  thinking above  phenomena, events and processes.“24
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page000101">101</pagenum>


<h1>
	    page no: 101
</h1>

<h1>
	 Significance
</h1>

  <p>
	 The significance of concepts stems from their ability to transfer information in the form of
images about experiences in the empirical world. By means of concepts, researchers can transmit to
their colleagues and to the public a whole system of experience acquired through research. ”25
</p>

  <p>
	 Useful  represent generalized abstraction regarding empirical phenomena. For example,
the concept ‘eight’ represents a trait common to various physical object, ‘Income’ represents a
trait common different persons. The usefulness of concepts is evaluated by the extent to which
they permit meaningful classification of objects or traits. “Concepts, then, are means not only of
communication but also of generalizations.”26
</p>

 <p>
	 As generalizations, concepts are useful for constructing assumption. The liking of two or more
concepts leads to the generation of assumptions, such as “if concept A, then concept B” or “the
greater A, the smaller B.” the combination of a number of assumption into a system leads to the
construction of formal theories. For example, people belong to various levels of “social class” —
another concept“ democratic participation” an assumption —— ‘Democratic participation covaries
with social class’ — be constructed. The addition of a number of further interrelated assumptions
will bring about a formal  theory from which researchers may deduce propositions.
</p>

<h1>
	Characteristics of Concepts
</h1>


<p>
	concepts have several Characteristics. It is important for a researcher to understand them.
</p>

<p>
	1. Concepts are symbols which we attach to the bundle of meanings that we hold.

2. Concepts represent only one part of reality. That is, we abstract only certain meaning or
   implications out of the object for our use. For example, a concept like book means different
   things to different persons according to their needs. To the author, it is an embodiment of
   his organized thoughts; to the publisher and seller, it is a physical object of a given weight
   and volume.

3. Thus different people hold different concepts of the same thing.

4. COncepts also represent various degrees of abstraction. For example, a specific calculator,
   at a first level of abstraction 15 considered as a mechanical devise for making mathematical
  computations. At the third level, it may be considered as an item of office equipment. And
  so on. Each of these levels of concept abstraction lS useful for one purpose or another. For
  a study of computation satisfaction, the first level is relevant; for a study of office
  productivity, level 2 and 3 may be of interest.
</p>

<h1>
	  Types of Concepts
</h1>
  <p>
	concepts may be classified into (a) concrete concepts and (b) abstract concepts.

  concrete concepts symbolize material objects, which can be seen, touched and felt, e.g., book,
table, building.

Abstract concepts refer to properties or characteristics of objects, e. g, weight, height,
attitude, intelligence, leadership. They are constructs, i.e., they represent inferences deduced
from observable.
</p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page000102">102</pagenum>



<h1>
	    page no :102
</h1>

<p>
events. They symbolize inferences “at a higher level of abstraction from concrete events and the
meaning cannot be easily conveyed pointing to specific objects, individuals or events.”27
</p>

<p>
	The concrete observable events which represent the abstract concepts or constructs are called
variables. While constructs are the abstractions, variables are representations of constructs. Any
construct (e. g., social status, power or intelligence) can be measured in many different ways,
because there are a variety of concrete representations of any abstract idea. 28 For example,
‘power’ represent the amount of influence a person has at his organization, at home, in the
neighbourhood in the mass media or in the political circle. Each of these representations is a
different variable, if they are all related to the construct. Taken together they are what we mean by ‘power.’
</p>

<h1>
	Problems in Defining Concepts
</h1>

<p>
	The process of defining concepts is not easy. Even in defining such common place objects a
‘book’, or ",water we may face difficulties. We can point these objects and show pictures of them
but to present a precise word picture is extremely difficult. Abstract concepts like ‘motivation’
‘intelligence’, or ‘frustration’ are still more difficult to define. Unclear and inadequate
definition  lead to lack of clarity in scientific communication. Some of the reasons for this problem are given below.
</p>

<p>
	1. Concepts develop from a shared experience: When scientists perceive or experience
particular things, they symbolise them through scientific terms. The dictionary definitions are
seldom satisfactory  What a chemist means by ",titration demographer by t‘he net reproductive
rate’, or management expert by ‘the managerial effectiveness’ would require very elaborate verbal
definitions. They can be best understood by participating in the operations to which these terms
refer.
</p>

<p>
	2. Term used to denote scientific concepts may also have meanings in other frames of
reference: many scientific words are newly coined or taken from Greek or Latin roots, e. g, Audire
from ‘Audire’ , cooperation from ‘co- operari’ . Concepts may also be named after their discovered
e. g., “Raman’s Effect”. These concepts have their scientific meanings only. But many scientific
term are taken from common usage, e. g. ‘mass’ ——— a big pile of something —— refers to a quality
of matter in physics, ‘culture which means tillage or rearing — refers to the totality of the
social heritage of a society in sociology. Such multiple meanings of concepts cause confusion.
</p>

<p>
	3. A term may refer to different phenomena: For example, the term ‘function’ has several
usages. In popular usage, it means ceremony. In economic sense, it means activity (e. g.,
functions a commercial bank); in a mathematical sense, it refers to relationship, e. g., the level of living function of economic position. And so on. Such words cause confusion.
</p>

<p>
	4. Different terms may refer to the same phenomenon: For example, the words ‘enquiry’
‘study’, ‘research’, investigation’, have similar meanings; ‘status’, rank’, 'position’ have
similar meanings. A scientist may use such different words with some subtle differences in meaning
,but his reader may take them as synonyms.
</p>

<p>
	5. A term may have no immediate empirical referent: Some concepts may have logical
relationship with other concepts, but may not be empirically measurable, e .g., ‘social milieu’ or
‘social structure’ in sociology, ‘managerial effectiveness’ in management are not empirically measurable.
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page000103">103</pagenum>

 <h1>
	    page no:103
</h1>
<p>
   6. The Meaning of concepts may change: Terms are continuously modified, as knowledge
accumulates. Definitions change and the consequent shifts in meaning confuse the reader. For
example, the term ‘intelligence’ originally was conceived as an inherited stable intellectual
potential. Now it is redefined as a ‘score’ made on certain types of tests.
</p>

<h1>
Types of Definition of Concepts
</h1>

<p>
   Different levels of abstraction and the combination of abstractions into constructs are
 important to research. In communication, there is a constant interplay among levels of
 abstracting and types of meaning. Accordingly, concepts may be defined in several ways: (1)
ostensive definition, (2) verbal definition descriptive definition and (4) operational definition.
</p>

<p>
   Ostensive definition: A concept may be defined ostensively. Russell describes ostensive
   definition
as “any process by which a person is taught to understand a word other than by the use of other
words."29 We may define ‘elephant’ by pointing to a life-like model of elephant; ‘typing’ may be
defined by pointing to the typing work performed by a typist. This kind of definition is not suitable for verbal communication.
</p>

<p>
   Verbal definition: This means definition of a word in terms of other words either at the same
or a higher or lower level of abstraction. For example, a customer is defined as a ‘.patron’ This
definition is of no value unless one understands the meaning of patron. Of even less value is a
definition in terms of higher- level abstractions, e. g., a definition of customer as a source of
business income. It says very little about the nature of customerness or patronage.

 Verbal definitions are of two types. (1) descriptive definitions and (2) operational definitions.
</p>

<p>
     Descriptive or Nominal definition: This is a dictionary type definition in terms of other
concepts. This also known as a conceptual definition. Conceptual definitions that facilitate
communication  have two traits. First, a concept is described by other concepts, not by itself, e .g.,
The definition of ‘power’ as ‘the ability to use power’ is useless. But a description in terms of lower
level abstraction is more useful, e. g., the definition of a customer as one who buys the products or
service from a given firm. Second, a positive definition is preferable to a negative one. For example,
defining “intelligence as “a characteristic that lacks form, colour and weight’ contributes little to communication. The descriptive definitions of concepts are of little value in research
where we  seek to measuring concepts.
</p>

<p>
	Operational definition: This is quantification of a nominal definition, i. e., it is a
definition in terms
of specific measuring or testing criteria or operations. This definition specifies the operations
which observe, measure and record the phenomenon symbolized by the concept. These criteria should
define a person, action, condition or phenomenon in an unambiguous manner. The criteria should
also be so objective that any competent observer can secure the same results by using the
definition. Some example of  descriptive and operational definitions of concepts are given below:
</p>

<p>
   Only when operational definitions are used, can variables be measured with precision and
 consistency, and through the corresponding empirical observations, can hypotheses and theorizes
 be tested.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000104">104</pagenum>

<h1>
	   page no: 104
</h1>

<p>
	The important definition criteria of operational definition are: (1) adequacy of meaning, (2)
 precision of meaning, and (3) linkability. Linkability means combination of two or more concepts
the development of concept interrelationship such as propositions, hypotheses and theories. In the
sense, ‘concepts are the knots 1n a network of systematic interrelations in which laws and
theoretical principles form the threads.”30
</p>

<p>
	Hypothetical concepts: Concepts that cannot be given operational definitions are usually
as hypothetical concepts.”31 Opinions regarding their role in the, scientific method vary. Bridgman a founder of the operational approach, claimed that concepts which cannot be operationally defined
prevent scientific progress. According to him, the sole meaning of concepts is related to their
operation “the concept is synonymous with the corresponding set of operations. ”33

This orthodox operational approach did not stand the test of time, since it was recognized the
hypothetical concepts had an important role in the stage of theorizing. For example, “subconscious" a hypothetical concept, has served in developing theories of personality and behaviour.
</p>

<h1>
	Steps in Operationalization of Concepts
</h1>

<p>

	Operational definitions of concepts are the means by which we quantify variables. They are
always necessary in a research project.

 The process of operationalization or defining concepts operationally is a complex task, requiring
extensive knowledge and reflective thinking. It involves a series of steps or procedures to be
followed  to obtain a measurement. The broad steps involved in the process of Operationalization are as follows.

   The researcher should select the major concepts from the title of the research problem, the
objectives of the study, the investigative questions and the hypotheses. He should attempt to
operationally define each of those concepts in the following manner:
</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page000105">105</pagenum>


 <h1>
	   page no:105
</h1>

<p>
 1. Examine the definition of the concept in the published literature- books, research articles,
etc keeping the chronology of the definitions in mind.
</p>

<p>
  2. Discover the various usage of the concepts and analyze the apparent meaning elements of the
concept, e.g., concept of political participation’ consists of such elements as (a) awareness of
voting right, (b) awareness of citizen’s responsibilities, (c) an analysis of the manifestoes of
contesting parties and their political philosophy and economic policy, and (d) choosing a
particular party and voting for it.
</p>

<p>
  3. Identify the measurement criteria relating to the meaning element and specify appropriate
quantitative measurements for thoSe criteria. This step is relatively easier in the case of
concrete
concepts. For Example, the maximum limit of investment in plant and machinery for defining a small
-scale unit is fixed as so many lakhs of Rupees. Usually the limit fixed by the government
is adopted in Such cases.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of an abstract concept, identify the indirect operations which observes and measure
the phenomenon symbolized by the concept, and construct a measuring scale by assigning appropriate
score to each of them on the basis of their relative importance. (For details see topic 5.6 of
Chapter
5, and topic 8.3 of Chapter 8, below).
</p>

<p>
   4. Formulate a tentative definition based on the measurement dimension or the measurement
scale, as the case may be.
</p>

<p>
  5. Submit the definition to as wide a critical appraisal as possible.
</p>
<p>
  6. Make final revision on the basis of the legitimate criticism received.
</p>

<p>
  7. Examine the the degree of congruence between the conceptual definition and the operational
 definition the concept. If ‘intelligence’ is defined conceptually as ‘the ability to think abstractly’
and operationally by an ‘intelligence test’ what is the congruence between the two definitions? Does
the score secured by an individual in the intelligence test represent everything that the concept
 ‘intelligence’ is supposed to convey?
</p>

<p>
	The degree of this congruence can be evaluated with the aid of validity tests discussed in
section 5.6 and and Chapter 11, below.
</p>

<p>
	An operational definition speciﬁes so precisely the process of measuring a variable that any one
else could at the steps and obtain the same measurement. HoweVer, the limitation of any operational
definition should be recognized. “Its very specificity and concreteness limit the breadth and depth of
what we are able to measure.”34 Thus, it is rarely sufficient to capture the rich and complex ideas
contained in a theoretical construct. A researcher should be aware of this inadequacy and imperfection
of an operational definition. He should do his best to improve his operational definition of
concept.
</p>

<p>
	Illustration: Let us illustrate the Operationalization of a concept of Socio-Economic
development” which is the ultimate aim of planning in developing countries like India. What is
Socio-Economic development”? What are the relevant socio- economic criteria, which indicate
development? How can ‘socio- e-conomic development’ be measured? Two approaches seem to have
emerged in this regard. The first is mainly associated with the work going on at the United Nations
research institute for Social Development (UNRISD) and the other primarily with the World Bank
and the institute for Development Studies of the University of Sussex (IDS). The UNRISD studies
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page000106">106</pagenum>

<h1>

</h1>

<p>
	aim at devising unitary indices which reflect broad -based socio-economic development. As a system
of interdependent variables, development is measured by building up a composite index consisting a
carefully chosen socio-economic indicators. 35 This index, like the per capita output index does not
reflect the quality of development.
</p>

<p>
	The IDS- World Bank approach adopts an index of development36 which in a
single social welfare function combines the objectives of growth and
distribution of equity. The social welfare function is conceived of as =

        G= w1 g1 + w2 g2 +w3 g3 +w4 g4+ w5 g5

Where ‘G’ is the index of growth of total social welfare, ‘w1’ is the weight
assigned to the game
‘1’, and ‘g1’ is the rate of growth of income of each group (classified into
quintiles by income  of assets or any other criteria).
</p>

<p>
	Another very similar concept of development comes from Dudley Seers, for whom the essential
criteria of development are the reduction of poverty, inequality, and unemployment.37 The world
Bank- IDS concept of development does not specifically use the employment criterion which
Seers does. While stressing such criteria as reduction of poverty inequality, and unemployment, they
should not be implied that “economic” growth as well as equity, so that it is truly “socio-economic
in character, it must be based upon criteria which can measure changes over time in the aggregate
output as well as the existing production potential of the economy, and also throw adequate light
the emerging style of its development. While the former would take care of the ‘growth’ or" ‘economic’
aspect, the latter would account for ‘equity ‘or ‘social’ aspect of development. This is, therefore, the
raison d’etre behind a synthetic approach to the concept of development.
</p>

<p>
	 Sharma adopts such a synthetic approach in his study.38
</p>

<p>
	His approach aims at measuring the following aspects of development:
1. The actual growth of the economy over time measured 1n terms of the GNP time- series
2. The growth potential level measured in terms of infrastructural indices:

(a) demographic features like literacy ratio and trends toward urbanization, level of development of social overhead capital, level of development of human capital.

3. The extent of socio— economic structure is measured in terms of ——
(a) the share of primary, secondary and tertiary sectors in total output and employment
(b) the share of different commodity groups in the total labour force; and

4. The distributional parameters of actual growth is indicated by ——
(a) share of different social groups or income classes in variables like income, consumption skills or productive assets,

 (b) level of unemployment and under-employment,
</p>
















<pagenum page="normal" id="page000107">107</pagenum>

	   page no:107
</h1>

<p>
(c) degree of socio- economic integration of tribals and other depressed classes achieved, as reflected in indices like the gap between the average and the class- s—pecific income, consumption and skill levels.
</p>

<p>
	The indicators enlisted above are only suggestive. The choice of indicators would
vary from one
study to another and would depend on the unit of study, the purpose of study and
availability of data.
</p>

<p>
	On the basis of the above conceptual model, Sharma has included the following indicators in
the composite development index39 for comparing inter—state comparison of development performance:
</p>

<h1>
 Development Index
</h1>

<p>
I. Aggregative Socio-Economic Features

 1. per capita income

 2. per capita monthly expenditure in rural areas

 3. per capita monthly expenditure in urban areas

 4. unemployment rate

</p>

<p>
II. Poverty  Indicators

1. per capita monthly expenditure of the bottom decile of cultivator households
2. per capita monthly expenditure of rural non- cultivating wage earner households
3. population below the poverty line (to be defined)
4. extent of —- under nutrition (percentage of calorie — deficient consumer units).

</h1>

<h1>
Introduction
</h1>

<p>
	In social science research we have to deal with various social and psychological
variables. Their measurement is one of the vital stages in the research process. The
measurement of social and  psychological variables is a complex and demanding task.
There has been increased interest in measurement in social sciences during the past 35
years. This section is devoted to discuss the meaning and nature of measurement, the
need of measurement, its functions the level of measurement measurement procedure and
validity and reliability of measuring instruments.
</p>

<h1>
	What is Stevens Measurement?
</h1>

<p>
	Stevens40 defines measurement as “the assignment of numerals to objects or events according
to rules.” Campbell41 defines it as “the assignment of numbers to represent properties
.”  “According to
Torgerson measurement is “the assignment of numbers to objects to represent amounts or degrees of
a property possessed by all of the objects.42 Suppose we desire to conduct a study of persons who
seek admission to MBA. programme. One point of interest is to compute sex- wise percentage of
applicants. We may examine the applications received and map or match the observed properties of
applicants into a sex classification. The rule of correspondence is: if the applicant is a male, assign
to ‘0’, if female, assign to ‘1’. Any other symbols such as ‘M’ and ‘F’ may be used, since the number
codes are for identification only. Thus, measurement in its simplest form consists of assigning numerical
or symbols to real objects and this process is called mapping. A numeral has no quantitative meaning
unless one imputes to it such a meaning. Numerals can be used to label objects like individuals, event
or things. Numerals that are given quantitative meaning become numbers; these enable the use of
mathematical and statistical techniques for purpose of description, explanation and prediction.
</p>

<p>
	The assignment of numerals or numbers to objects is done according to a rule. A rule explicate
the way in which numerals or numbers are to be assigned. It is the most significant component of the
measurement procedure, because it determines the quality of measurement. The range of its uses
increases with the exactness of the measurement.
</p>

<h1>
	What is Measured?
</h1>

<p>
	Concepts43 used in research consist of ‘objects’ and ‘properties’ (i. e., characteristics) of objects
For example, a person’s physical properties consists of height, weight etc. In a research process, we
measure the properties of objects — not the objects themselves. Abstract properties like intelligence.
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page000109">109</pagenum>

<p>
motivation, attitude cannot be directly observed; one must infer them from the observation of presumed
indicants of the properties. We infer a child ’s level of intelligence from the score which he secures
in an intelligence test. Thus, we actually measure indicants44 of the properties of objects. The indicants
from which properties are inferred are specified by operational definitions,45 i. e., definitions that
specify the observations of the behavioural indicants of properties.
</p>

<h1>
Need for Measurement
</h1>

   Why do we need to measure social or psychological variables? When the researcher develops
an explanation for a social phenomenon or problem, he constructs a theory. The theory is tested
through the verification of a hypothesis derived from it. A hypothesis can be verified statistically, only
when the variables in it are measured. Thus, the need for measurement arises.

<h1>
Functions of Measurement
</h1>

  <p>
	 Measurement serves several purposes. First, it facilitates empirical description of social and
psychological phenomena.
</p>

  <p>
	For example, in a study of a tribal community, the researcher has to classify and categorize the
cultural patterns and behaviours he observes. Measuring devices assist him in the classification process.
</p>

  <p>
	second, measurement renders data amenable to statistical manipulation and treatment. The
of statistical techniques for comparing groups, studying relationships between variables,
etc. is possible, only when the data collected through various methods are amenable to quantification.
Measurement devices make it possible to quantify variables.
</p>

 <p>
	 Third, measurement facilitates testing of theories and hypotheses. Theories are formulated to
explain and predict soCial phenomena (e. g, ethnic conflict, communal disharmony, labour unrest,
delinquency, etc.) and psychological phenomena (6. g, low morale, job satisfaction, attitude, etc.)
Researchers derive hypotheses from these theories and subject them to empirical test. Once the
variables hypotheses are quantified through measuring devices, the hypotheses can be tested easily.
</p>

   <p>
	Fourth, measurement enables researchers to differentiate between Objects or people in terms of .
specific properties they possess. Do girls perform better then boys in college examinations? Does
productivity vary among work groups? To deal with such questions, it is necessary to measure the
concerned variables. Measurement of variables enables us to classify individuals or objects and thus
yo differentiate between them. In this way, measurement performs a classificatory function.
</p>

 <p>
	The above four functions are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but are inter-related, and
complimentary to one another.
</p>


<h1>
		Measurement Postulates
</h1>


  <p>
	 Since the measurement is based on numbers, the properties of numbers are relevant to
measurement. These properties are; (1) identity (or equality), (2) rank order and (3) additivity. The

concept of additivity implies all the four fundamental operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
</p>

<p>
	44. According to Kerlinger an indicant is “merely a convenient word used to mean something that points to something

else." See Kerlinger, Fred N. Foundations of Behavioural Research, Delhi: Surjeet Publications, 1983, p. 432.

 <h1>
	    page no:110
</h1>

<p>
	With reference to the above characteristics, there are three postulates46 basic to measurement. They are:
</p>

  <p>
	 1. Order: numbers are ordered. One number is greater than, less than, or equal to another.
     a > b or a&lt; b or a= b
    if a=b and b =c, then a=c
    if a= p and b= q, then a+b= p+ q.

   2. Distance: difference between numbers are ordered. The difference between any pairs of
numbers is greater than, less than or equal to the difference between any other pair of numbers.

   3. Origin: the number series has a unique origin indicated by the number zero.
</p>

<h1>
Levels of Measurement
</h1>

    <p>
	Combinations of the above characteristics of order, distance and origin
provide the following four levels of measurement:

Levels                 Characteristics

Nominal                no order, distance or origin

Ordinal                order, but no distance or origin

Interval               both order and distance, but no origin

Ratio                  order, distance and origin
</p>

<p>
	Nominal measurement: This is the simplest and lowest level of measurement. This level
involves the categorization of variable into several nominal sub— classes by assigning numerals or any
other symbols to mutually exclusive sub-classes. For example, the variable ‘sex’ is classified into two
categories: ‘male’ and ‘female’, assigning ‘1’ to male and ‘2’ to female; ‘religion’ may be classified
into five categories, 1. Hindus, 2. Sikhs, 3. Muslims, 4. Christians, and 5. others: ‘caste’ in terms
of ritual status into three categories: 1. high, 2. medium, 3. low. And so on. The numerals 1,2,3...
assigned to categories of variable are just labels only and have no quantitative value.
</p>

  <p>
	 Nominal measurement is the least powerful of the four levels. It indicates no order or distance
relationship and has no arithmetic origin. The only quantification possible is counting the number of
cases in each sub- class or category. For analysis, we can use mode, chi square test and co- -efficient
of contingency test.
</p>

   <p>
	 Nominal measurement is useful for categorizing" personal variables, types of organizations, work groups, etc.
</p>

   <p>
	Ordinal measurement: In this level of measurement objects or persons are ordered by rank
from least to most on a continuum, with respect to an operationally defined property. Ranks are
assigned 1n ascending or descending orders: the highest categories ‘1’, the next ‘2’, the third one ‘3’
and so on or the lowest category ‘1’, the next higher one ‘2’, the next one ‘3 and so on. The numbers
indicate rank order only They do not indicate that the intervals betWeen them are equal, nor do they
indicate absolute quantities. Thus, the real difference between ranks ‘1’ and ‘2’ may be more or less
than the difference between ‘2’ and ‘3’.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000111">111</pagenum>

<h1>
	    page no:111
</h1>

<p>
  Various relationships may be used for ranking such as ‘greater than’, ‘higher than’; ‘more
desired’, difficult’, superior to’, ‘happier than’ and so on.
</p>

<p>
	border classification may be based on either one property or composite properties. For
example, if we have to rank individuals according to their socio economic level, we have to consider
several variables like income, education, occupation, wealth, ritual status etc. In such cases we have
to give relative weights to each variable and arrive at composite score. In terms of composite scores,
individuals could be ranked.
</p>

 <p>
	The procedures used for construction of ordinal scales include rank, order
, rating, paired comparison.
</p>

<p>
  Most common variables suitable for ordinal measurement include economic status, social class,
social distance, attitude, opinions, preferences, prestige ranking, ratings of organizations, and test performances.
</p>

<p>
	The statistical techniques suitable for ordinal scales are:

Measure of central tendency      : Median

Dispersion                       : Percentile or quartile measure

Correlation                      : Rank order coefficients

Statical test of Significance    : Non-parametric methods
</p>

<p>
    interval measurement: This measurement has the powers of nominal and ordinal measurements
plus one additional strength —— the concept of equality of interval, but the numbers on an interval
scale cannot be multiplied or divided because the scale does not have a true zero. It has an arbitrary
zero only. Temperature gauge- Centigrade or Fahrenheit thermometer —— is a typical example for
internal level of measurement. In reading it we know that ’40 degrees’ is exactly 10 degrees warmer
than 30 degrees and 10 degrees cooler than 50 degrees. Altitude based on sea level and calendar years
are another examples for interval measurements.
</p>

<p>
	Internal scales not only provide powerful measurement but also are quicker to complete. But it
	is difficult to use them for measuring socio- economic and psychological variables.
</p>

<p>
	More powerful statistical techniques can be used with interval scales. The suitable techniques
of statistical analysis are:

Measure  of central tendency    : Arithmetic Mean

Dispersion                      : Standard deviation

Correlation                     : Product moment technique

Statical test of Significance    : ‘t’ test and ‘F’ test.
</p>

<p>
   Ratio measurement: This is the highest and most ideal level of measurement. This is suitable
for measuring properties which have natural zero points. Examples are weight, height, distance, area,
money value, population counts, rate of return, etc. Since there is an absolute or natural zero, all
arithmetic operations including multiplication and division are possible. Numbers on a ratio scale
e. g., weight of students 1n a school) indicate the actual amounts of the property under measurement.
A weight of 50 Kg is twice as large as that of 25 Kg.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000112">112</pagenum>

<h1>
	     page no:112
</h1>

<p>
	Behavioural and psychological properties like social participation, leadership quality, happiness
intelligence, aptitude, morale, satisfaction etc. do not have true zero points. Hence, it is not not possible
to use ratio scales for their measurement.
</p>

<p>
	Variables that can be measured at a ratio level can also be measured at the interval, ordinal and
nominal levels. As a rule, properties that can be measured at a higher level can also be measured as
lower levels, but not vice versa.
</p>

<p>
	All statistical techniques usable at nominal, ordinal and interval levels are usable with ratio
scales. In addition, geometric and harmonic means and co-efficient of variation can be used.
</p>

<h1>
	The Characteristics of a Good Measurement Tool
</h1>

<p>
	A measurement too] must satisfy certain criteria. The most important criteria to be used to
evaluating a measurement tool are described below:

1. Unidimensionality: This means the scale should measure one characteristic at a time, e .g.,
the ruler should measure length, not temperature also.

2. Linearity: This means that a Scale should follow the straight- line model. Some scoring
system should be devised, preferably one based on inter-changeable units. In a ruler an inch is an
whether it lies at one end of the ruler or at the other, but in altitude scales such interchangeability
cannot be ensured. In such cases, ranking is preferable.

3. Validity: This refers to the ability of a scale to measure what it is supposed to measure. For
a detailed discussion see separate sub- title in this section).

4. Reliability: This is an attribute of consistency. A scale should give an accurate  and
measure of what we want to measure.

5. Accuracy and Precision: A tool should give an accurate and precise measure of what we want to measure.

6. Simplicity: A scale Should be as simple as possible; an elaborate, complicated and over
refined scale may become unduly cumbersome, costly or even useless.

7. Practicability: This is “concerned with a wide range of factors of economy, convenience an
interpretability....47 “Some trade off is usually needed between an ‘ideal’ tool and that which the
budget can afford. The benefit to be derived should commensurate with the cost incurred.
</p>

<p>
	The tool should be easily administrable; it should contain proper instructions; it should be easily
understandable and conveniently arranged for easy completion.
</p>

<p>
	In order to enable others to interpret the results of a test, there is need for such aids as a
statement of its function, its construction procedure and guides for interpreting the result
</p>

	<h1>
	Construction of a Measurement Tool
</h1>


<p>
	The process of constructing a measurement tool, involves the following general steps:

1. Concept identification: The first step is to gain a thorough knowledge of the topic under
study through observations, a careful study of the literature and discuSsions with experts. The concept
of the selected problem under study should be identified.
</p>

</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000113">113</pagenum>

<h1>
	 page no:113
</h1>

<p>
   2. Concept development: Each concept should be defined operationally. (See “Steps in
Operationalization of Concepts” in 5.5 Concepts in Chapter 5, above).
</p>

<p>
   3. Concept specification:48 By an analysis of the phenomena out of which the concept. emerged,
we should develop “aspects”. “components”, “dimension” or similar specifications. They are derived
logically from the concept or empirical observations reported in studies. For example, the concept of
‘cooperate ( or company) image’ consists of such dimensions as product reputation, employer role,
customer satisfaction, corporate leadership, contribution to social welfare and concern for environment.
similarly, the concept of ‘buyer behaviour’ consists of the following dimensions: brand advertisement
recall, brand awareness, brand preference, purchase decision, and brand royalty/ shift.
</p>

<p>
   4. Indicator selection: The next step is to develop the indicators by which to measure each
element or dimension of the concept. Indicators are specific questions, statements or other devices by
which respondent’s knowledge, opinions, expectations, etc. are measured. Since there is seldom a
perfect or absolute  measure of a concept, we should consider several possibilities. A set of questions .
or a scale may be used depending on the‘ nature of the element to be measured.
</p>

<p>
	For example, a company’ s reputation for civic responsiveness may be rated by a scale as follows:
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Which of the following best describes the reputation of X company with respect its participation
in community development programmes? (please check one).

  - The company is a leader in these programmes

-The company is a strong supporter but not a leader in these programmes
-The company is a an average supporter of these programmes

-The company is a below- -average supporter of these programmes
-The company does not support these programmes
</p>

The brand awareness may be studied by a set of questions:

1. Are you familiar with product X?

2. What brands of product ‘X’ are known to you?

3. Through what sources have you come to know about the brands?

- friends/ neighbours

- advertisements in daily news papers

- advertisements in magazines

- advertisements in TV

- advertisements in Radio

- outdoor advertisements

- others (please specify).
</p>

<p>
	On the basis of several pre-test, the questions, or items should be finalized. Care should be taken
to see that they fully span the concept dimension.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000114">114</pagenum>

<h1>
	   page no:114
</h1>

<p>
    5. Formation of scale: The final step is to combine the indicators into a single composite scale
This is developed by assigning scale values to the responses and summing up the scores, giving
weightages in proportion to the relative importance of various elements constituting the concept under
measurement. After the scale is formed, checks are made on its reliability and validity. If these proved
satisfactory, the scale is then administered in the full survey.
</p>

<p>
	For a detailed discussion on various types of Scales, see topic 8.3 Measurement Scales as
Indices, in Chapter 8, below.
</p>

<h1>
Validity
</h1>

<p>
	Validity is an important requirement of a measuring instrument like attitude scale. validity
means the effectiveness (or success) of an instrument in measuring the specific property which is
intends to measure. The measurement of physical properties like height, weight, length etc., does not
pose the problem of validity, because it is direct and standardized measuring devices are available
But measurement of abstract properties like attitude, morale, motivation etc. is indirect and gives rise
to the problem of validity. It becomes necessary to gather some sort of evidence to show that the
concerned measuring instrument does in fact measure what it supposed to measure. The degree of
validity of an instrument is determined through the application of logic and/ or statistical procedures
“A measurement procedure is valid to the degree that it measures what it purports to measure.
</p>

<p>
	Type of validity: Validity is concerned with different aspects of the measurement situation.
Accordingly, it is classified into content validity, predictive validity and construct validity. Each of
these types uses either logic, statistical verification or both for
determining the degree of validity  and has special value under certain conditions.
</p>

<p>
	Content validity: There are two forms of content validity: face validity and sampling validity
Face Validity is a logical type resting on the investigator’s subjective evaluation as to the validity of
a measuring instrument. For example, an investigator may construct a scale containing 10 or 15
statements to measure the variable “liberalism”. He then evaluates each statement to assess whether
its construct is related to “liberalism”. He may also request some specialists (judges) to asses this
If there is an agreement among the judges, the researcher may be satisfied with the face validity of
the scale. However, face validity is a poor way of determining validity; it is often a matter of opinion.
</p>

<p>
	Sampling Validity refers to the representative character of the content of the instrument. Every
variable has a content universe of items (statements, questions or indicators) reflecting the indicants
to be measured. The measuring instrument’s content must adequately represent the content universe
of the property being measured. Sampling validity can be determined by comparing the instrument
items with the universe of items that could theoretically be included.
</p>

<p>
	The mail problem with content validity is that it has to rely entirely on subjective judgement as
to the relevance of scale items and to the definition of the universe of items from which the scale is
drawn. The degree of content validity thus rests primarily on the knowledge,
skill and judgement of the instrument designer and /or judges, as the case may be.
</p>

<p>
	Predictive validity: This refers to empirically measured association between the results produced
by the instrument and the subsequent actual outcome. For example, an admission test’s predictive
validity may be examined by computing the correlation coefficient between the admission test scores
of the freshmen and their grade- -point averages during the first year of study. If this coefficient is
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page000115">115</pagenum>

 <h1>
	    page no:115
</h1>

<p>
greater tan the predictive validity of the admission test is established. However, this statistical
association between predicted outcome and subsequent exhibited outcome is no conclusive indicator
of the predictive validity; because the exhibited outcome might have been influenced by a different
set of extraneous variables. Since behaviour varies from situation to situation, the prediction of one
behaviour from another is a dangerous procedure, unless the situations in which the behaviours occur
are psychologically same. The task of prediction is, then, the forecasting of behaviour in a
specified situation from a knowledge of the relevant characteristics of the persons.50
</p>

<p>
	Construct validity: On the basis of theoretical reasoning, an investigator may perceive various
kinds and degree of relationships between a property under study and other constructs (or variables).
In order to determine the construct validity of a measuring instrument, the investigator has to find that
these relationships in fact exits. For example, Rokeach51 on the basis of theoretical reasoning, constructed
a dogmatism scale This instrument consists of statements believed to tap close- mindedness, a way
of thinking presumably associated with any ideology. Rokeach theorized that the ideological orientations
of individuals are related to their thought processes and behaviours, and predicted that dogmatism 1s
related to intolerance and opinionation. He undertook an extensive series of investigations to test his
theory and construct validity of his scales. In one study he used the known- -groups method. In this
methods, groups of people With “known” characteristics are administered as instrument and the
direction of difference is predicted. Rokeach found that Catholic students were more dogmatic than
protestants, as predicted He also found that communist obtained higher scores on the dogmatism scan than did liberals.
</p>

<p>
	Process of construct validity: Cronbach and Meehl52 describe the logical process of construct
validity: first, a proposition that an instrument measures a certain property - say, property A— is set
fourth; second, the proposition is inserted into the present theory of property A, third, working through
the theory, one predicts other properties that should be related to the instrument and prOperties that
should exhibit no relation to the instrument, finally, one collects data that empirically confirm or
reject the predicted relations. If the anticipated relationships are found, the instrument is considered
valid. If the predictions do not holdup, there are three (1) the instrument does not measure property
A; (2) The theoretical framework that generated the predictions is incorrect; or (3) the research design
failed to the prediction properly. The researcher must then decide as to which of these three
condition has occurred by careful reconstruction of the above process of validation.
</p>

<p>
	Method: The important methods used for validation are: (1) the known groups method; (2) the.
multitrait-multimethod matrix method, (3) factor analysis.
</p>

<p>
	The Known group methods: In this method, the instrument is administered to people with
known characteristics. It 1s valid if it discriminates between the groups. For example, if Communists,
Naxalites Democrats obtain different scores on a scale measuring political attitudes, then the scale is valid.
</p>

<p>
	The Multitrait-multimethod matrix method: This was suggested by Campbell and Fiske. 53
This involves the convergent- discriminant conception of validity. Convergence means that different
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page000116">116</pagenum>


<h1>
	        page no: 116
</h1>

<p>
	method of measuring a particular property should yield similar results. Discriminability means that
different properties should yield different measurement results even though a similar instrument
used. In a multitrait-multimethod analysis, at least two properties are measured and each is measured
by at least two different methods. The interCorrelations among variables within and between method
are computed and analyzed. Correlation coefficients among scores for a given property measured by
different methods should be higher than correlations among different properties measured by different instruments.
</p>

<p>
	Factor analysis is perhaps the most powerful method of construct validation. This is a statistical
technique designed to determine the basic components of a measure. For example, the factor analyze
of a measure of role clarity may show that the variable consists of three predominant factors
supervisory behaviour, seniority and group cohesiveness. (For detailed
discussion on Factor analysis see Chapter 11: Statistical Analysis).
</p>

<p>
	Which validity test to use: A researcher is concerned as to which validity test to use in
validating a given measurement instrument. Experts recommend that the validation should include
the three types of validity: content, empirical (i. e., predictive) and construct validity. In the first place
of the construction of a measuring tool, one might evaluate theories that would serve as a basis
the tool; next a content population of items from which a representative sample to be drawn night
be defined; and finally, the validity of the tool might be assessed by correlating it with an external criterion.
</p>
<h1>
Reliability
</h1>

<p>
	Reliability means the ability of a measuring instrument to give accurate and consistent result
For example, a weighing scale is reliable, if it gives the same reading when the same object is weighed several times.

   Reliability has two aspects: Stability and non- -variability or equivalence. An instrument is stable
if it gives consistent results with repeated measurements of the same Object. The degree of stability
is determined by comparing the results of repeated measurements with the same instrument. Along
with repeated observations, statistical measures of dispersion and correlation tests are used. while
stability is concerned with personal and situational fluctuations from one time to another, note-
variability or equivalence is concerned with variations at one point in time among investigators samples of items.
</p>

<p>
	Estimation of reliability: The degree of reliability of a measure is indicated by the extent
which it contains variable errors, i. e., differences in measuring results from object to object during
any one measuring instance and differences between different measurements of the same object a
different time by the same instrument. Since the measurements in social sciences are indirect, the
chances of having such variable errors are much greater than 1n physical science. Various factors such
as problem of memory or recall, personal characteristics of the respondents, environmental factors
irrelevance of instrument contents, and ambiguous instructions may cause variable errors.

Each measurement, then, consists of two components: a ‘true component and an
error component and so reliability is  defined as the ratio of the true-
score variance* to the observed- score variance. 54 This can be expressed as
</p>












<pagenum page="normal" id="page000117">117</pagenum>

<h1>
 	    page no: 117
</h1>

<p>
	Reliability = V1/Vx = Vx-Ve/Vx

where  Vx = variance of observed scores

       Vt = variance of true scores

       Ve= variance of errors
</p>

  <p>
	If the measurement involves nothing but error, then Vx = V6, and the reliability is zero. On the
in there is no variable error at all, Ve = O and the reliability becomes 1. Thus reliability
may vary from 0 to 1. In practice, it is impossible to compute directly the
of the error any measurement. Consequently, the ratio Vt/Vx has to be
estimated.
</p>

<p>
	Methods of estimating reliability: There are three major methods of estimating reliability: the
test- retest, the parallel- forms technique and the split -half method.
</p>

    <p>
	Test- rest method: A measuring instrument is administered to the same group of person at
different times. The coefficient of correlation between the two sets of scores is computed. The
obtained coefficient is a measure of reliability. Higher the coefficient,
higher the degree of reliability.
</p>

  <p>
	 The test -retest method has two main limitations. First, the respondents may remember how they
responded the first time and respond the same way second time. This might yield a high but over-
estimated reliability measure. Second, since human attributes are subject to change, it is possible that
changes may have occurred in the measured attribute during the measurement interval, thus lowering
the estimate of reliability. The test- retest method is thus not fool- proof.
</p>

  <p>
	 Parallel forms technique: One way of overcoming the limitations of the test- retest methods is
the use of two parallel forms of the same tool, containing different but relevant items. The two forms
are administered to the same group of persons, and the two sets of scores are correlated to obtain an
estimate of reliability The main problem of this method is the difficulty 1n determining the equivalence of the two tools.
</p>

   <p>
	 Split- half method: This method is designed to split the instrument into two sets halves — say,
odd- numbered items as one half and the even- numbered items as second half. Each half is used as
a separate instrument and the scores of both halves are correlated.
</p>

  <p>
	The obtained correlation coefficient is corrected by applying the Spearman -Brown Prophecy
formula 2'h/(1+’h) where rn= the coefficient of the full scale, rh= coefficient obtained by correlating
the scores to two halves. This correction assumes that an instrument 2n items long will be more
reliable than an instrument‘ ’times long. Thus, the full instrument will have a higher reliability than
would either half. This can be true when the full instrument is empirically a unity and each half contains sufficient items to be reliable itself.
</p>

<p>
	How to improve reliability: The reliability of an instrument can be improved by (a) minimizing
the external sources of variation, (b) improving internal consistency of the instrument, and (c) broadening
the sample of items used. The external sources of variation can be minimized by standardizing the
conditions under which the measurement takes place, by improving investigator consistency by using
well trained investigators and by using clear and standard instructions.
</p>

   <p>
	The internal consistency of an instrument can be improved by item analysis as explained in
item analysis, a subsection in 8.3 Measurement Scale and Indices, below. Items which have little
discriminatory power can then be dropped from the scale.
</p>

</h1>

<p>
	The Sampling base can be broadened by adding similar items to the instrument. The probability
of a chance error being balanced by another opposite random error is greater when there are more
items. Thus, more items increase the probability of accurate measurement.
</p>

<p>
	The adequacy of reliability can be examined in terms of research objectives and the nature of
the population under study. If our objectives call for rough estimation, then a relatively crude instrument
will probably suffice. For more precise estimation, higher standards of reliability are required.
relatively homogeneous population, a crude measure may be reliable, because variations in the
are limited. A heterogeneous population calls for a more reliable instrument.‘
</p>

<p>
	Relationship between validity and reliability: Validity and reliability as measurement properties
are significantly interrelated. An instrument that is valid, is always reliable. An instrument that is an
valid may or may not be reliable. A reliable instrument need not be valid; but a non reliable instrument
is never valid, because a necessary condition of validity is reliability. Reliability is more directly
demonstrated statistically and /or logically, whereas validity is often
inferred by a comparison predicted and/ or measured behaviours.

	                5.7 RESEARCH DESIGN OR PLAN
</h1>

<h1>
	Meaning
</h1>

<p>
	A research design is a logical and systematic plan prepared for directing a research study. In
specifies the objectives of the study, the methodology and techniques to be adopted for achieving
objectives. It ‘constitutes the blueprint for the collection, measurement and analysis of data. it is
“the plan, structure and strategy of investigation conceived so as to obtain answers to research
questions... The plan is the overall scheme or program of research.”56 A research design is the
program that guides the investigator in the process of collecting, analyzing and interpreting
observations.”57 It “provides a systematic plan of procedure for the researcher to follow.”58
</p>

<h1>
Essentials of a Good Research Design
</h1>

<p>
	The above definitions give the essentials of a good research design. They are:

1. It is a plan that speciﬁes that objectives of the study and the hypotheses to be tested.

2. It is an outline that speciﬁes the sources and types of information relevant to the research questions.

3. It is a blueprint specifying the methods to be adopted for gathering and analyzing the data.

4. It IS a scheme defining‘ ‘the domain of generalizability, 1. e., whether the obtained information
can be generalized to a larger population or to different situations. ”59
</p>


<h1>
	Nature of Research Design
</h1>

<p>
	A research design is indispensable for a research project. However, it is not a precise and
specific plan like a building plan to be followed without deviations, but rather a series of guidepost.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000119">119</pagenum>

	  page no:119
</h1>

<p>
to keep one going in the right direction. It is a tentative plan which undergoes modification, as
circumstances demand, when the study progresses, new aspects, new conditions and new relationships
come to might insight into the study deepens. For example, the sCope of a study may be narrowed
down, when is discovered that certain kinds of data are not available, the sampling method may
be modified from ‘random sampling with probability.- proportional to size to
simple random sampling’
if a list of study with particulars of size is not readily available; and so on.
</p>

<p>
	Besides, a research study cannot be extensive and intensive as the researcher may like it to be.
It has to be the availability of data and the cooperation of the informants. It has also to be
kept with in manageable limits, i. e., within the researcher’s mental ability to grasp the implications,
his competence and the amount of time and other resources available for the
purpose. Thus, a research
design represent a compromise dictated by many practical considerations. ”60
</p>

<h1>
Classification of Designs
</h1>

<p>
	there are a number of crucial research choices, various writers advance
different classification schemes, some of which are:

1. Experimental, historical and inferential designs (American Marketing Association)

2. Exploratory, descriptive, descriptive and causal designs (Selltiz, Jahoda, Deutsch and Cook)

3. Experimental, and ex -post fact (Kerlinger)

4. Historical method, and case and clinical studies (Goode and Scates)

5. sample surveys, field studies, experiments in field settings, and laboratory experiments (Festinger and Katz)

6. Exploratory, descriptive and experimental studies (Body and Westfall)

7. Exploratory, descriptive and causal (Greed and Tull)

8. Experimental, ‘quasi- experimental designs’ (Nachmias and Nachmias)

9. True experimental, quasi—experimental and non- experimental designs (Smith)

10.  Experimental, pre- experimental, quasi- experimental designs and Survey Research (Kidder and Judd).
</p>

<p>
	These different categorizations exit, because ‘research design’ is a complex concept. In fact,
these are different perspectives from which any given study can be viewed. They are:

1. The degree of formulation of the problem (the study may be exploratory or formalized)

2. The topical scope — breadth and depth —— of the study (a case or a statistical study)

3. The research environment: field setting or laboratory (survey, laboratory experiment)

4. The time dimension (one-time or longitudinal)

5. The mode of data collection (observational or survey)

6. The manipulation of the variables under study (Experimental or ex- post facto)
7. The nature of the relationship among variables (descriptive or causal).

The different types of designs have been discussed in Chapter 3, above.

	  Importance of Research Plan, page no:120
</h1>


<p>
	A research without a pre —drawn plan is like an ocean voyage without Mariner’s compass. The
preparation of a research plan for a study aids in establishing direction to the study and in knows
exactly what has to be done and how and when it has to be done at every stage. It enables to
researcher to consider beforehand the various decisions to be made: What are the objectives of the
study? What are the investigative questions? What are the sources of data?
What is the universe
the study? What sampling method is appropriate? And so on.
</p>

<p>
	Without a plan, research work becomes unfocussed and aimless empirical wandering, the
researcher would find it difficult, labourious and time— consuming to make adequate discrimination
in the complex inter plan of factors before him; he may not be able to decide which is relevant are
which is not, and may get lost in a welter of irrelevancies. The use of a research design prevents such
a blind search and indiscriminate gathering of data and guides him to proceed in the right direction.
</p>

<p>
	A research, plan prescribes the boundaries of research activities and
enables the researcher channel his energies in the right work.
</p>

<p>
	With clear research objectives in view, the researcher can proceed
systematically toward the achievement.
</p>

<p>
	The design also enables the researcher to anticipate potential problems of data gathering Operationalization of concepts, measurement, etc.61
</p>

<h1>
Preparation of the Research Design
</h1>

<p>
	Planning involves deciding things in advance. Accordingly, the preparation of a research
involves a careful consideration of the following questions and making appropriate decisions on them.
</p>

<p>
1. What the study is about?

2. Why is the study made?

3. What is its scope?

4. What are the objectives of the study?

5. What are the propositions to be test?

6. What are the major concepts to be defined operationally?

7. On the basis of what criteria or measurements, the operational definitions to be made?

8. When or in what place the study will be conducted?

9. What is the reference period of the study?

10. What is the typology of the design?

11. What kinds of data are needed?

12. What are the sources of data?

13. What is the universe from which the sample has to be drawn?

14. What is the sample size?

25. What is the cost involved?
</p>

  <p>
	These questions should be considered with reference to the researcher’s interest, competence,
time and other resources and the requirements of sponsoring agency, if any. “Thus, the considerations
which enter into making decisions regarding what, where, when, how much, by
what means constitute a plan of study or a study design. 62
</p>


<h1>
	The Contents of a Research Plan
</h1>

    <p>
	After making decisions on the above questions, a formal research plan is drafted, incorporating
those decisions. The format may vary depending on the purpose for which the study is undertaken,
but, in general, the research plan of a research student/ academician may
cover the following essential sections:
</p>

 <p>
	  1. Introduction: The introduction of a research plan or propoSal should place the research
problems in his historical perspective, state the need for studying it, and the researcher’ s precise
interests study of the problem.

    2. Statement of the problem: The research problem should be well defined, pointing out its
core nature and its importance. The issue relating to the problem may also be
stated. This statement gives direction  to the research process.

   3. review of the previous studies: On the selected theme, some studies might have been
previously made by other. A review of available literature will bring out information on them. The
silent features of those studies may be briefly described and the gaps may be pointed out. Does the
selected study fill in the gap? Or is it a replication of an earlier study made elsewhere? In the later
case the justification for studying the same problem may be stated with reference to environmental
difference, temporal difference, etc.

4. Scope of the study: A complete study of any problem is well nigh unmanageable. It would
entail over-whelming volume of data that it would require more than a student’s life-time to
comprehend and complete the study. Therefore, the scope and dimensions of the study, should be
delimited with reference to the topical scope — breadth and depth, geographical area to be covered,
reference the type of institutions/ respondents to be studied, the issues to be analyzed, etc. The
purpose of this demarcation is to make the study manageable 1n terms of the researcher’ s aim, intereSt
and competence and available techniques, time, finance and facilities.

<p>
	Research scholars are invariably ambitious, take up a vast study, not knowing the time and other
requirements, and later find it difficult to complete the work within the prescribed time limit. In the
anxiety to complete the work, they are forced to sacrifice its depth and quality. Therefore,
essential to delimit the study from the stand point of manageability. Yet it should provide the research
with an opportunity to gain a systematic experience of planning and conducting a research study make some contribution to the fund of knowledge.
</p>


<p>
	5. Objective of the study: The specific objectives of the study should be stated clearly. this
refer to the questions to which the researcher proposes to seek answers through the study, Although
there is no limit to the number of research objectives, it is desirable to limit the objectives
reasonable number. What is reasonable depends upon the time limitation,
resource constraints, capability etc. it is wise to pick objectives that are
challenging but not impossible to achieve.

  The objectives may be stated as under:

  To study the extent of

  To identify the factors which influence

  To examine the nature of relation between   and

  To investigate the impact of

  To identify the causes of

   The statement of objectives should not be vague or nebulous like “to study
industrial marketing in India”; “to explore unemployment in India” and the
like.

   These statements are vague, as they fail to specify what exactly are aimed at. The statement
should be specific and indicate the exact purpose of the study. Such precise
statements give function guidelines to the research process.

   The statement of objective may be followed by a statement of the investigative question
relating to each of the research objectives. (See Section 5.3, in Chapter 5, above).
</p>

<p>
	6. Conceptual model: This section is the heart of the research plan. This is where the researchable
formulates and develops the structure of relationships among the variables he is investigating. The
logical connection of the variables is delineated; the assumptions, and propositions used to developing
the explanatory framework are included. The entire research project rests upon the theoretical framework (See Section 1.4 in Chapter 1, above).
</p>

<p>
	7. Hypotheses: These are logically deduced from the theoretical framework above. These researchable
to the anticipated outcome or possible answers to the research questions. They should be conceptual
clear, specific and simple. (See Section 5.4 of this Chapter, above).
</p>

<p>
	8. Operational definition of concepts: The major concepts used in the title of the study, the
objectives, the investigative questions and the hypotheses should be identified. Each of them
be defined in operational terms pertinent to the measurement criteria or operations. (See section of this Chapter, above).
</p>

<p>
	9. The significance of the study: It is important to point out the relevance and significance
the investigation. What would be the value of the findings of the study for policy formulation, they
or practice? Can the findings contribute to the enrichment of theory and/ or to the solution of
practical problems? A careful statement of the value of the study and the
possible application of finding helps to justify its importance and social
relevance.

be decided and specified in the plan. The area to be chosen depends on the
purpose of the study and time and other resources available.
</p>

<p>
	11. Reference period: This period may be one year or two or more years depending on the
nature of the study and availability of data. The period should be longer, say 5 or 10 years, if the study
aims at making a trend. analysis of an activity like production or sale or
profitability.

<h1>
	                 6.1 INTRODUCTION
</h1>


<h1>
Concept
</h1>

   <p>
	 Empirical field studies require collection of first- hand information or data pertaining the
of study from the field. The units of study may include geographical areas like districts, talukas, cities
or villages which are covered by the study, or institutions or households about which information
required, or persons from whom information is required, or persons from whom information
available. The aggregate of all the units pertaining to a study 18 called the population or the universe Population is the target group to be studied
</p>

<p>
    	It is the aggregate of elements about which we wish to make inferences
. A member of the
population is an element. It is the subject on which measurement is taken. It is the unit of the study.
part of the population is known as a sample. The process of drawing a sample from a larger population
is called sampling The list of sampling units from which a sample is taken is called the samples
frame, e. g., a map, a telephone directory, a list of industrial undertakings, a list of car licenses etc.
</p>

<p>
	Illustration 1: A researcher desires to study the attitude of students of Master of Education o
a college of education towards semester system. A student of that course is a unit of study. The total
of all Master Education student of that course is a unit of study. The list of M. Ed. student from which a sample will be drawn is the sampling frame.
</p>

<p>
	Illustration 2: A researcher wants to survey the brand preferences of households regarding
toilet soaps in Jayanagar area of the city of Bangalore. A household is the sampling unit. The total
of all households in Jayanagar area is the population. Suppose in a detailed map of Jayanagar,
list of households is not available, each block may be considered a sampling unit. A list of section blocks will be used as the frame.
</p>

<h1>
	                        SAMPLING, page no:129
</h1>

<h1>
Aims of sampling
</h1>

 <p>
	Well -selected sampling may reflect fairly accurately the characteristics of the population. For
example, with a survey of a sample of voters, one can predict the voting intentions of millions of
voters. A specified value of the population, such as average of variance is named parameter; the
corresponding value in the sample is termed a statistic. The chief aim of sampling is to make an
inference about an unknown parameter from a measurable sample statistic.
</p>

<p>
	A second aim of sampling is to test a statistical hypothesis relating to population. A sample is
collected from the sample informants are analyzed and on the basis of the
result the hypothesis  be accepted or rejected.
</p>

<h1>
Census vs. sampling
</h1>

<p>
	The process of designing a field study, among other things, involves a decision to use sampling
or not. The researcher  must decide whether he should cover all the units or a sample of units. When
all the units studied, such a complete coverage is called a census survey. When only a sample of
the universe studied, the study is called a sample survey.
</p>

<p>
	In making this decision of census or sampling, the following factors are considered:

  1. The size of the population: If the population to be studied is relatively small, say 50
institution or 200 employees or 150 households, the investigator may decide to study the
entire population. The task 18 easily manageable and the sampling may not be required. But
if the population to be studied is quite large, sampling is warranted. However, the size is
a relative  matter. Whether a population is large or small depends upon the nature of the
study, the purpose for which it is undertaken, and the time and other resources available for it.

2. Amount of funds budgeted for the study. The decision regarding census or sampling
depends upon the budget of the study. Sampling is opted when the amount of money
budgeted is smaller than the anticipated cost of census survey.

3. Facilities: The extent of facilities available— staff, access to computer facility and accessibility
to population elements- is another factor to be considered in deciding to sample or not.
When  the availability of these facilities is extensive, census survey may be manageable.
Other Wise, sampling is preferable.

4. Time: The time limit within which the study should be completed is another important
factor to be considered 1n deciding the question of census or sample survey- This, in fact,
is a primary reason for using sampling by academic and marketing researchers.
</p>


<h1>
Characteristics of Good Sample
</h1>

<p>
	Whether the result obtained from a sample survey would be accurate or not depends upon the
quality of the sample. The characteristics of a good sample are described below.
</p>

<p>
	1. Representativeness. A sample must be representative of the population. Probability sampling
technique1 yield representative sample. In measurement terms, the sample must be valid.
The validity of a sample depends upon its accuracy and precision.

</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000130">130</pagenum>

<h1>
	    page no: 130
</h1>

<p>
	2. Accuracy: Accuracy is defined as the degree to which bias is absent from the sample
accurate (unbiased) sample is one which exactly represents the population. It is free from
any influence that causes any difference between sample value and population value average).
</p>

<p>
	3. Precision: The sample must yield precise estimate. Precision is measured by the stands
error or standard deviation of the sample estimate. The smaller the standard error or estimate
the higher is the precision of the sample. (See Section 6.4, below).
</p>

<p>
	4. Size: A good sample must be adequate in size in order to be reliable. (For a detail
discussion of sample size, See Section 6. 4, below). The sample should be of such size in the inferences drawn from the sample are accurate to the given level of confidence.
</p>


<h1>
Basis of Sampling
</h1>
<p>
	Sampling is based on two premises. They are:

1. There is such similarity among the elements in a pOpulation that a few of these element
will adequately represent the characteristics of the total population. For example, the attitude
of postgraduate students towards the examination system can be gauged by studying  attitudes of a few representative postgraduate students in a) university.

2. While the sample value (statistic) or some sample units may be more than the population
value (parameter), the sample value of other sample units may be less than the population
value. When the sample is drawn properly these differences tend to counteract each order
With the result, a sample value is generally close to the population value.

Thanks to these tendencies, sampling yields almost the same result as that of a census survey.
</p>

<h1>
	Advantages of Sampling
</h1>

<p>
	Why is sampling used? What are its advantages? The advantages of sampling are many.
</p>

<p>
	First, sampling reduces the time and cost of research studies. Thanks to the use of sampling
has become possible to undertake even national or global studies at a reasonable cost and time. some
economy in time and cost improves the viability of several field studies like credit surveys, poverty surveys and marketing surveys.
</p>

<p>
	Second, sampling saves labour. A smaller staff 1s required both for fieldwork and for processing and analyzing the data.
</p>

<p>
	Third, the quality of a study 18 often better with sampling than with a complete coverage. the
possibility of better interviewing, more thorough investigation of missing, wrong or suspicion
information, better supervision, and better processing is greater in sampling than in complete coverage
No wonder that the accuracy of decennial population censuses in USA, India and other countries checked by making sample surveys.
</p>

<p>
	Fourth, sampling provides much quicker results than does a census. The speed of executive
minimizes the time between the recognition of a need for information and the availability of the
information. The speed of execution is vital in feasibility studies, evaluation studies and business
research. Timely execution of a study is essential for making use of its findings.

   <p>
	Fifth, sampling is the only procedure possible, if the population is infinite, e. g, throws of dice, consumer behaviour surveys, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Last, statistical sampling yields a crucial advantage over any other way of choosing a part of
the population a study. That is, when the estimates of the population characteristics are made from
the sample result, the precision of these estimates can also be gauged from the sample results
themselves. (for explanation, See Section 6.4, below).
</p>

<h1>
	  Limitations of  Sampling
</h1>

<p>
	Sampling is, however, not free from limitations.

1. sampling demands a through knowledge of sampling methods and procedures and an exercise of greater care; otherwise the results obtained may be incorrect or misleading.

2. When the characteristic to be measured occurs only rarely in the population, a very large
sample is required to secure units that will give reliable information about it. A large sample
has all the drawbacks of a census survey.

3. A complicated sampling plan may require more labour than a complete coverage.

4. It may not be possible to ensure the representativeness of the sample, even by the most
perfect sampling procedures. Therefore sampling results in a certain degree of sampling
errors i.e., there will be some difference between the sample value and the population value. (see Section 6.5, below).

<h1>
	                    Exhibit 6.1: Sampling Methods
</h1>

<p>
	Each of the above sampling methods is discussed separately in subsequent pages.
</p>

<h1>
	Probability Vs. Non- Probability Sampling
</h1>

<p>
     Probability sampling 1s based on the theory of probability. It is also known as random
sampling It provides a known non- zero chance of selection for each population element.

Its characteristics are:
1. In probability sampling every population has a chance of being selected.

2. Such chance is a known probability. For instance, if a sampling frame is a list of
   students of a specific course of study, in a simple random sample, each student has 1/10.
   chance of being selected.

3. Probability sampling yields a representative sample, and hence the findings of
   survey are generalizable to the population.

4. The closeness of a sample to the population can be determined by estimating sampling
  or error (which we will discuss in more detail later. See Section 6.5, below). Through
  randomization, the danger of unknown sampling bias can be minimized. Hence, probability
  sampling is preferable to non- probability sampling.

Probability sampling should be used when generalization 1s the objective of study, and a great
degree of accuracy of estimation of population parameters is required. Cost and time required
probability sampling may be large. Hence, the benefit derived from it should justify the cost.

Non- -probability sampling or non- random sampling is not based on the theory of probability
This sampling does not provide a chance of selection to each population element. The only merits of
this type of sampling are simplicity, convenience and low cost.

Its merits are:

1. It does. not ensure a selection chance to each population unit.

2. The selection probability is unknown.

3. A non— probability sample may not be ,a representative one.

  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000133">133</pagenum>


 <h1>
	         page no:133
</h1>

<p>
4. Non- probability sampling plan does not perform inferential function, i. e., the population
    parameters  cannot be estimated from the sample values.

5. It Suffers from sampling bias, which will distort results.

   Therefore, non-random is not a desirable method. Yet there are some practical reasons for using
it. Those reasons are:

1. When There is no other feasible alternative due to non-availability of a list of population,
    non-availability of some population elements for collection of data, etc;

2. When the study the study does not aim at generalizing the findings to the population, but simply at feelings the range of conditions, or nature of the phenomenon,

3. When the cost required for probability sampling may be too large, and the benefit expected
   from it is not commensurate with such costs; and

4. When probability sampling requires more time, but the time constraints and the time limit
  for completing the study do not permit it.

<h1>
Random sampling - Procedures
</h1>

<p>
	The nature of randomness in sampling needs no emphasis It is a means for securing a
representative sample. How can a random sample be drawn? The layman tends to think that random
sampling means picking out units‘ ‘at random”, i. e., in a haphazard or hit- and- -miss way. Experience
shows the human being is an extremely poor instrument for the conduct of a random selection.
To ensure randomness the method of selection must be independent of human judgement. There
are three basic procedures.
</p>

<p>
	1. The lottery method: This is the simplest and most familiar procedure of random sampling.
If a sample 10 students is to be drawn out of a list of 50 students in a section, take 50 equal size
chips or slips paper; number them from 1 to 50 each bearing only one number. Roll each slip. Put
the rolled in a global container and thoroughly shuffle or mix them. Take 10 chips from the
container one after another. Each time before drawing a chip, mix the chips in the container thoroughly. The units bearing the numbers of chips drawn constitute the random sample.
</p>

<p>
   In the above sampling procedure, there are two alternatives. After a number is selected by draw,
it may be replace and consequently it has a chance of being selected again. Such a method is known
as sampling with replacement. This is usually referred to as unrestricted random sampling. Alternatively,
the selected number is set aside, and so in the subsequent draws, it does not get a chance of being
selected again type of sampling is known as sampling without replacement. This is a form of
restricted sampling.
</p>

<p>
	Sampling with replacement guarantees each element an equal and independent chance of being
selected in each draw. However an element previously drawn and replaced in the vessel has a chance
of being draw again. But the common procedure is not to count it again as an item of the sample.
For, it is to ask a respondent to ﬁll in a questionnaire twice.
</p>

<p>
	Lottery method is useful for drawing a small sample from a small population. But it would be
time consuming and tedious if the population is very large.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000134">134</pagenum>

<h1>
	    page no:134
</h1>

 <p>
	 2. The use of table of random numbers: This is a less cumbersome, but equally valid procedure
of sample selection. Tables of random numbers have been developed by Kendall and Smith (1939)
Fisher and Yates (1963) and Tippett (1927). One of them is usually found in a standard book on
Statistics or Methodology of Research. To select a random sample out of a given frame, one
simply start to read numbers from a Table of Random Numbers at any randomly selected point
pick out numbers within the range of the frame. This procedure is illustrated below.
</p>

<p>
	Let us suppose that random sample of 50 is to be selected from a college population of 50
commerce students. We can use any table of Random Numbers.
</p>


<p>
	 Let us suppose, we start at the top of the left hand second column. As the population consists
of a three -digit figure, read three -digit columns, i. e., read 097, 542,422, 019 and so on. All
The numbers within the range of 1 to 500 may be picked out. Then the sample will consist of:

    097,422,019, 065,060,269 and so on. In the above reading, 542,807, 573, etc. are rejected
because they are over 500.
</p>

<p>
	When the researcher reaches the bottom of a column, he can simply move one digit to the right
and start at the top of the column again, and read numbers in three- digits: 973, 420, 226,079
and so on.
</p>

<p>
	The main advantages of the use of a Table of Random Numbers are:
</p>

<p>
	Easy to use and ready accessibility.

    The Table of Random Numbers is ideal for obtaining a random sample from relatively small
populations. When populations are quite large say lakhs or crores, drawing numbers from the table
becomes tedious.
</p>

<p>

    3. Use of computer: If the population is very large and if computer facilities are available.
computer may be used for drawing a random sample. The computer can be programmed to print out
a series of random numbers as the researcher desires.
</p>

<h1>
	Simple Random Sampling
</h1>

 <p>
	This sampling technique gives each element an equal and independent chance of being selected
An equal chance means equal probability of selection, e. g., in a population of 300, each element.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000135">135</pagenum>

 <h1>
	    page no: 135
</h1>

<p>
	theoretically has 1/300th chance of being selected. In a population of 1000, each element has 1/1000th
chance of being selected. Equal probability selection method is described as Epsem sampling. An
independent chance means that the draw of one element will not affect the chances of other elements
being selected.
</p>

   <p>
	 Where some elements are purposely excluded from the sample, the resulting sample is not a
random one. Hence, all elements should be included in the sample frame to draw a random sample.
</p>

   <p>
	Procedure: The procedure of drawing a simple random sample consists of:

     Enumeration of all elements in the population,

     Preparation of a list of all elements, giving them numbers in a serial order 1, 2, 3... so on,
     and

      Drawing Sample numbers by using (a) Lottery method, (b) a table of random numbers or
     (c) a computer.
</p>

   <p>
	Suitability: The simple random sampling is suitable only for a small homogeneous population.
It may yield a representative sample under the following conditions:

(1) Where the population is a homogeneous group with reference to the specified characteristics,
   e. g., students studying in fifth standard in a boys school form a homogeneous group as
   regards level of education and age group;

(2) Where the population is relatively small, and

(3) Where a complete list of all elements is available or can be prepared.
</p>

  <p>
	 The simple random sampling is not suitable for drawing a sample from a large heterogeneous
population; as it may not yield a representative sample of such population.
</p>

<p>
	  Advantages: Some advantages of simple random sampling are:

(1) All elements in the population have an equal chance of being selected.

(2)Of all the probability sampling techniques, simple random sampling IS the easiest to apply.

(3) It IS the most simple type of probability sampling to understand.

(4) It does not require a prior knowledge of the true composition of the population.

(5) The amount of sampling error3 associated with any sample drawn can easily be computed.
</p>

  <p>
	 Disadvantages: The simple random sampling techniques suffers from certain drawbacks.
   (1)  It is often impractical, because of non-availability of population list, or of difficulty in
   enumerating the population. For example, it is difficult to get a current accurate list of
   households 1n a city or a list of landless rural agricultural labourers who migrate from area
   to area in search of employment or a list of households of a nomadic tribe.

  (2) The use of simple random sampling may be wasteful because we fail to use all of the known
      information about the population.

   (3)This technique does not ensure proportionate representation to various groups constituting
     the population.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000136">136</pagenum>

  <h1>
	    page no:136
</h1>

   <p>
(4) The sampling error in this sampling is greater than that in other probability samples of the
    same size, because it is less precise than other methods.

(5) The size of the sample required to ensure its representativeness is usually larger under this
    type of sampling than under other random sampling techniques.

(6) A simple random design may be expensive in time and money.
</p>

<p>
	These problems have led to the development of alternative superior random sampling designs
like stratified random sampling, systematic sampling, etc.
</p>

<h1>
	Stratified Random Sampling
</h1>

 <p>
	 This is an improved type of random or probability sampling. In this method, the population is
sub-divided into homogeneous groups or strata, and from each stratum, random sample is drawn. For
example, university students may be dividend on the basis of discipline, and each discipline group
may again be divided into juniors and seniors; and the employees of a business undertaking may be
divided into managers and non- managers and each of those two groups may be sub- divided into salary grade- wise strata.
</p>

<p>
	Need for stratification: Stratification is necessary for (1) increasing a sample’s statical
efficiency, (2) providing adequate data for analyzing the various sub- p—opulations, and (3)
applying different methods to different strata.4

   Stratification ensures representation to all relevant sub- -groups of the population. It is thus  more efficient statistically than simple random sampling.

   Stratification is essential when the researcher wants to study the characteristics of population
sub-groups, e .g., male and female employees of an organization.

Stratification is also useful when different methods of data collection, etc. are used for
parts of the population, e. g., interviewing for workers and self- administered questionnaire for executives.
</p>

<p>
  Suitability: The stratified random sampling is appropriate for a large heterogeneous population.
</p>

<p>
	Stratification process: This involves three major decisions:

(1) The stratification base or bases to be used should be decided. The ideal base would be the
  principal variable under study- For example, if the size of firms is a primary variable, the
   firms may be stratified on the basis of the block capital employed.

(2) The number of strata: What should be the number of strata? There is no precise answer to
   this question. Larger the number of strata, greater may be the degree of representativeness
   of the sample. The decision may be based on the number of sub- population groups to
   studied and the cost of stratification. Cochran5 suggests that there is little to be gained in
   estimating overall population values when the number of strata exceeds six.

(3) Strata sample sizes: There are two alternatives. First, the strata sample sizes may be
   proportionate to strata’s shares in the total population. Second, they may be disproportionate
   to Strata’s shares. Accordingly stratified random sampling may be classified into
   (a) Proportionate stratified sampling and (b) Disproportionate stratified sampling.
 </p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000137">137</pagenum>

<h1>
	     page no:137
</h1>

<h1>
Proportionate Stratified Sampling
</h1>

<p>
	This sampling involves drawing a sample from each stratum in proportion to the latter’ s share
in the total population. For example, if the final year MBA students of the Management Faculty of
a university consist of the following specialization groups:
</p>


    <p>
	Thus, proportionate sampling gives proper representatiOn to each stratum and its statistical
efficiency is generally higher. This method is, therefore, very popular.
</p>

<p>
	Advantages. The Principal advantages 0f proportionate stratified sampling are:

(1) It enhances the representativeness of the sample by giving proper representation to all sub-
    groups in the population.

(2) It gives higher statistical efficiency than that given by simple random sampling for a given
    sample size.

(3) It is easy to carry out this sample method.

(4) This method gives a self- weighing sample, the population mean can be estimated simply by
     calculating the sample mean.
</p>

<p>
	Disadvantages: The drawbacks of the proportionate stratified random sampling are:

(1) A prior knowledge of the composition of the population and the distribution of the population
    characteristics are required to adopt this method.

(2) This method is very expensive in time and money. Of course its greater efficiency may
    offset the additional cost.

(3) The identification of the strata might lead to classification errors. Some elements may be
    included into the wrong strata. This may vitiate the interpretation of survey results.
</p>

<h1>
	Disproportionate Stratified Random Sampling
</h1>

 <p>
	This method does not give proportionate representation to strata. It necessarily involves
giving over representation to some strata and under representation to others. There may be several
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000138">138</pagenum>

<h1>
	     page no:138
</h1>


<p>
	disproportionate schemes. All strata may be given equal weight, even though their shares in the total
population vary. Alternatively some substrata may be given greater weight and others lesser weight
When is such disprOportionate weighing preferable?
</p>

<p>
   The desirability of disproportionate sampling 1s usually determined by three factors, viz., (a)
the sizes of strata, (b) internal variances among strata, and (c) sampling costs.

    The guideline suggested by Cochran is:

    In a given stratum, take a larger sample if

   (a) the stratum is larger,
   (b) the stratum is more variable internally, and
   (c) sampling is cheaper in the stratum.6
</p>

<p>
	If the elements of a stratum are more mixed or variable, then it would be sensible to take a larger.
sample from it in order to make it representative of the stratum. Similarly, if the cost per sampling
unit is expected to be greater in some strata than in others, one could increase the cost effectiveness by taking a less proportionate sample in the costlier strata.
</p>

<p>
	Usage: This method of disproportionate sampling. is not widely used. However, it is appropriate
to use it under the following circumstances:

(1) When the population contains some small but important sub—groups.
(2) When certain sub-groups are quite heterogeneous, while others are homogeneous; and

(3) When it is expected that there will be appreciable differences in the response rates of the
   sub-groups in the population.7 But the above differences should be several- fold to
  disproportionate sampling worthwhile.

Disproportionate sampling cannot be used for population with unknown proportions of
characteristics, because correct sizes of strata samples cannot be determined. ”
</p>

<p>
	Advantages: The major advantages of disproportionate sampling are:

(1) It is less time consuming compared with proportionate sampling, because the researcher is
    not necessarily concerned about the proportionate representativeness of his resulting sample
    as in the latter method.

(2) It facilitates giving appropriate weighing to particular groups, which are small but more
    important.
</p>

<p>
	Disadvantages: The disadvantages of disproportionate sampling are:

(1) This method does not give each stratum proportionate representation. Hence, the result
    sample may be less representative.

(2) This method requires a prior knowledge of the composition of the population, which is not
    always possible.

(3) This method is also subject to classification errors. It is possible that the researcher may
    misclassify certain elements.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000139">139</pagenum>

 <h1>
	    page no:139
</h1>

<p>
   (4) Though disproportionate sampling is a means for developing an optimal Stratification scheme,
   its practical feasibility is doubtful because one generally does not know the relative variability in the strata nor the relative costs.
</p>

<h1>
Systematic Sampling or Fixed Interval Method
</h1>

<p>
	Meaning and process: This method of sampling is an alternative to random sampling. It
consists of taking every kth item in the population after a random start with an item from 1 to K For
example, suppose it is desired to select a sample of 20 students, from a list of 300 students, divide
the population total of 300 by 20, the quotient is 15. (if there is any fraction in the quotient ignore
the fraction and take the integer or whole number). Select a number at random between 1 and 15,
using lottery method or a table of random numbers. Suppose the selected number is 9. Then the
students numbered 9, 24 (9+15), 39 (24+15), 54 (39+15), 69, 84 ... are selected as the sample.
</p>

<p>
   As the interval between sample units is fixed, this method is also known as fixed interval
method.
</p>

<p>
	Applications Systematic selection can be applied to various populations such as students in a
class, houses in a street, telephone directory, customers of a bank, assembly line output in a factory, members of an association, and so on.
</p>

<p>
	Strictly speaking, this method of sampling is not a probability sampling. It possesses characteristics
of randomness and some non probability traits. Hence, it is sometimes called a ‘-pseudo -random’
sampling.
</p>

<p>
	Real systematic sampling: It is more appropriate to use the label “systematic sampling” to the
procedure of drawing a sample from a frame re- -arranged in a systematic order on the basis of the
population's important characteristic, e. g., arranging the farm households in a village in an ascending
or descending order of the size of their farms Such systematic re- -arrangement of the frame is
desirable for populations with greater variability. In such a case, even stratification cannot give proper
representation to all size groups. For example, for a farm management study, the farm size is a
primary variable. Suppose the size of farms of farmers 1n the area covered by the study varies widely
ranging from 0.2 hectare to 25 hectares. Even if they are stratified into 5 strata, viz., (1) upto 5
hectares,(2) 5 to 10 hectares, (3) 10 to 15 hectares, (4) 15 to 20 hectares and (5) 20 to 25 hectares,
there are greater variations in each stratum. Thus, even stratified random sampling may not yield a
good representative sample. But if the list of farmers is rearranged in ascending or descending order
of their farm sizes, and a sample is drawn at regular intervals with a random start, all size groups get
proper representation. Thus the degree of representativeness of this sample will be higher than
that of simple or stratified random sample of the same size.
</p>

<p>
	Hence, it will be more appropriate to call this kind of interVal sampling as systematic random
sampling.
</p>

<p>
Advantages: The major advantages of systematic sampling are:

(1) It IS much Simpler than random sampling. It is easy to use.

(2) It is easy to instruct the field investigators to use this method

(3) This method may require less time. A researcher operating on a limited time schedule will
   prefer this method.

(4) This method is cheaper than simple random sampling.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000140">140</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 page no:140
</h1>

<p>
(5) It is easier to check whether every ‘k’ th has been included in the. sample.

(6) Sample is spread evenly over the population.

(7) It is statistically more efficient than a simple random sample when population elements are
    ordered chronologically, by size, class, etc. Then systematic sampling gives a better
    representative sample.
</p>

<p>
	Disadvantages: The primary disadvantages of systematic sampling are:

(1) This method ignores all elements between two ‘k’ th elements selected. Further, except the
    first element, other selected elements are nOt chosen at random. Hence, this sampling cannot
    be considered to be a probability sampling in the strict sense of the term.

(2) As each element does not have an equal chance of being selected, the resulting sample is
   not a random one. For studies aiming at estimations or generalizations, this disadvantage
    would be a serious one.

(3) This method may sometimes give a biased sample. If by chance, several ‘k’ th element
    chosen represent a particular group, that group would be over-representated in the sample
</p>

<h1>
Cluster Sampling
</h1>

<p>
	Where the population elements are scattered over a wider area and a list of population element
is not readily available, the use of simple or stratified random sampling method would be too expensive and time- consuming. In Such cases cluster sampling is usually adopted.
</p>

<p>
	Meaning: Cluster sampling means random selection of sampling units consisting of population
elements. Each such sampling unit is a cluster of population elements. Then from each selected
sampling unit, a sample of population elements 1s drawn by either simple random selection or stratified random selection.
</p>

<p>
	Suppose a researcher wants to select a random sample of 1,000 households out of 40,000
estimated households in a city for a survey. A direct sample of individual households would be
difficult to select, because a list of households does not exist and would be too costly to prepare
Instead, he can select a random sample of a few blocks/ wards. The number of blocks to be selected
depends upon the average number of estimated households per block. Suppose the average number
of households per block IS 200, then 5 blocks comprise the sample. Since the number of households
per block varies, the actual sample size depends on the block which happen to be selected. Alternatively,
he can draw a sample of more blocks and from each sample blocks a certain number of households
may be selected by systematic sampling.

	Features: What makes a desirable cluster depends on the survey’s situation and resources. The
individual elements are determined by the survey objectives. For example, for an opinion poll, the
individual person is a population element, but for a socio-economic survey of households or a
consumer behaviour survey, a household may be population element or unit of study. The cluster may
institution or a geographical area or any other appropriate group depending on the nature of
survey.
</p>

<p>
  The number of elements in a cluster is called the cluster size. The clusters in most populations
are of unequal size, e .g., dwellings in blocks, persons in household, employees in section, farm
households in villages, etc. Clusters of equal size are often the result of planned conditions such as manufacturing, e .g., matches in match boxes, soap cakes in cases. They rarely exist in
nature or society.
</p>

<p>
	Cluster sampling vs. stratified sampling: How does cluster sampling compare with stratified
sampling? There are certain differences between them.
</p>

<p>
	Cluster sampling process: The process of cluster sampling involves the following steps:
</p>

<p>
   1. Identify clusters: What can be appropriate clusters for a population? This depends on the
nature of the study and the distribution of the population relating to it. The appropriate clusters may
be area units (e. g, districts, talukas, villages, blocks of a city) or organizations /organizational units
(e. g., schools colleges, factories, sections in a schOol or departments in a factory).

  2. Examine the nature of clusters: How homogeneous are the clusters? Clusters should not be
homogeneous in internal characteristics. A sample drawn from such clusters cannot fully represent the
population Hence clusters should be constructed 1n a way as to increase intra- cluster variance.
For example contiguous villages/ city blocks that contain different income/ social groups may be
combined into one cluster.

    Should the clusters be Of equal or unequal size? “The theory of clustering is that the means of
sample clusters are unbiased eStimates of the population mean”,9 This 18 generally true when clusters
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000142">142</pagenum>

<p>
are equal. But natural clusters often vary. The effects of unequal size may be reduced by 1)
combining small clusters and splitting large clusters or 2) stratifying clusters by size and
selecting clusters each stratum.
</p>

<p>
	3. Determine the number of stages: Shall we use single— stage or multistage clusters? This
depends primarily on the geographical area of the study, the scale of the study, the size of this
population and the consideration of costs. Depending on these factors, the following alternatives
are possible:

    (a) Single- stage sampling: Select clusters on a random basis and study all elements in each of the sample clusters.
   (b) Two- stage sampling. Select clusters and then select elements from each selected cluster.

    (c) Multi-stage sampling. Extend the above method to more stages. This is discussed in deal
under a separate subsequent sub— heading “Multi-stage Sampling”, in this chapter itself.
</p>


	 <p>
	Economy Vs. Accuracy: Cluster samples usually gives a less precise estimates than simple
random samples of the same size because of social area tendencies toward homogeneity. Why then
should cluster sampling be used? It is used simply because it cuts research costs and time. For
example, it is simpler, more convenient and cheaper to randomly select 20 street with 30 average
households each rather than to select 600 households ahead over an entire city. Interviewing units in
small geographic areas is more convenient and less costly. One need not also waste lot of time in
moving from one unit to another, because of their close special proximity. Thus, cluster sampling is economically more efficient in terms of time, cost and convenience.
</p>

  <p>
	 However, the statistical efficiency to cluster samples is relatively low, because they may not
fully be representative of the population.
</p>


   <p>
	Hence, we have to strike a balance between economic and statistical factors and consider the
net relative efficiency in adopting the cluster sampling.
</p>

   <p>
	Applications: The applications of the cluster sampling in social science research are extensive
particularly in farm management surveys, socio- economic surveys, rural credit surveys, demographic
studies, ecological studies, public opinion polls, large scale surveys of political and social behaviour, attitude surveys, and so on.
</p>

   <p>
	Advantages: The primary advantages of the cluster sampling method are;

  (1) This method is much easier and more convenient to apply when large Populations are
    studied or large geographical areas are covered. Even a ready list of population elements
    is not necessary. A researcher can simply draw a random sample of geographical selections
    and adopt single or multistage sampling depending on the vastness of the area covered by
    the study.

(2) The cost of this method is much less when compared with other sampling methods

(3) This method promotes the convenience of field work as it could be done in compact places.

(4) Sampling under this method does not require more time.

(5) Units of Study can be readily substituted for other units within the same random section.

(6) This method is flexible. Where it involves multistage sampling, it is possible to employ
    different types of sampling in successive stages.
</p>

<h1>
	  page no:143
</h1>


<p>
	Disadvantages This method has certain disadvantages. They are:

(1) The cluster sizes may vary and this variation could increase the bias of the resulting sample.
    For example, if the researcher were to interview all adults in households in each selected
    street the number of adults would vary from house to house. There would be certain bias
    resulting from the large coverage of big families.

(2) The sampling error in this method of sampling is greater. Thus, this method IS statistically
     less efficient than other probability. sampling methods.

(3) Adjacent units of study (e g., households) tend to have more similar characteristics than do
    units distantly apart. This affects the ‘representativeness’ of the sample and this effect is
    reflected 1n a greater sampling error.
</p>

<h1>
Area sampling
</h1>

<p>
	This is an important form of cluster sampling. In larger field surveys, clusters consisting of
specific geographical areas like districts, talukas, villages or blocks in a city are randomly drawn. As
the graphical areas are selected as sampling units in such cases, their sampling is called area
sampling. It is not a separate method of sampling, but forms part of cluster sampling.
</p>

<p>
	In a country like India where a state (previously known as a province) is divided into districts,
district into talukas and talukas into towns and villages areas sampling is done on the basis of these administrative units in multi- s—tages. (See ‘Multistage Sampling, below).
</p>

<p>
	Illustration: Where the area covered by a study is a city, to draw a random sample of
households, the following procedure may be adopted:

  (1) Take a map of. the concerned city and lay over it a transparent sheet with a grid system of
      lines (i. e., horizontal and vertical lines drawn at equal intervals).

  (2) The grid system divides the city into squares of equal size, say 100 areas.

  (3) Leave the, squares occupied by non-residential business and public buildings, parks etc. --
      say 30 squares.

   (4)Number the remaining squares in a serial order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 70 in a serpentine manner.

   (5)Estimate the average number of households in each square on the basis of house counts in
      a few squares. Say the average number of households is 80.

   (6) If the required sample of households is, say 640, determine the number of squares to be
       selected by dividing this total by 80, i. e., 8 squares.

   (7) Select eight squares out of 80 on a simple random basis using a table of random numbers;
       or by adopting systematic random sampling method, i. e, every 10th (80/8 =10) square with
       a random start.

   (8) Study all households in each of the sample eight squares. The total sample would be 8 x
       80 = 640 or a little less or more.
</p>

<p>
	 Where different socio- economic class of households are found to be concentrated in specific
areas of the city, it is desirable to stratify the areas on an identifiable basis, then

     Draw a random sample of proportionate number of areas from each strata.

     Prepare a list of households in each of the selected areas.

     Select randomly a proportionate number of households in each of these lists.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000144">144</pagenum>

<h1>
	       page no:144
</h1>


<p>

	Alternatively divide each of the selected area into smaller areas of almost equal size called
segments and select randomly a proportionate number of segments in each sample area and  survey
all households in each of the selected segments.
</p>

<p>
	Area sampling invariably involves multi- -stage sampling and sub- sampling. (See below).
</p>

<h1>
	Multi-stage Sampling
</h1>

 <p>

	In this method, sampling is carried out in two or more stages. The population is regarded as
being composed of a number of first stage sampling units. Each of them is made up of a number
second stage units and so forth. That is, at each stage, a sampling unit is a cluster of the sampling
units of the subsequent stage. First, a sample of the first stage sampling units is drawn, then from each
of the selected first stage sampling unit, a sample of the second stage sampling units is drawn. The
procedure continues down to the final sampling units or population elements. Appropriate random
sampling method is adopted at each stage.
</p>

 <p>
	Usage: Multi-stage sampling is appropriate where the population is scattered Over a wider
geographical area and no frame or list is available for sampling. It is also useful when a survey has to be made within a limited time and cost budget.
</p>

<p>
	Advantages: The crucial advantages of multi-stage sampling are:

1. It results in concentration of fieldwork in compact small areas and consequently in a savings
   of time, labour and money.

2. It is more convenient, efficient and flexible than single- stage sampling.

3. It obviates the necessity of having a sampling frame covering the entire population.
</p>

<p>
	Disadvantages. The major disadvantage of the multi- -stage sampling is that the procedure of
estimating sampling error and cost advantage is complicated. It is difficult for a non-
statistician follow this estimation procedure.
</p>

<h1>
Sub- sampling
</h1>

<p>
	Sub- sampling  is a part of a multi-stage sampling process. In multi-stage sampling, the sampling
in second and subsequent stage frames is called sub- sampling. Suppose that from a population of
40,000 households in 800 streets of a city, we want to select a sample of about 400 households. We
can select a sample of 400 individual houSeholds (elements) or a sample of 8 streets (cluster). The
sample of 400 elements would be scattered over the city, but the cluster "sample would be confined
to 8 streets. Clustering reduces survey costs, but increases the sampling error Sub- sampling balances
these two conflicting effects of clustering. In the above case, first a sample of say 80 streets may be
drawn and from each of the selected street a 10% sub sample of households may be drawn. In each
of the above stages, an appropriate probability sampling- simple random/ stratified random sampling
systematic random sampling may be adopted.
</p>

<p>
	Control of Sampling Size: One of the problems of cluster sampling is the problem of greater
inequality in cluster sizes. The total sample size is subject to large variation if it is based on a random
selection of clusters that differ greatly in size. If we sub sample the selected clusters at a fixed
the total sample size of elements depends on which clusters are chosen at the first stage. With a large
cluster of 10,000 a second- s-tage sampling fraction of 1/1000 gives a sample of 100 persons, while
With a small cluster of 2,000 persons it yields only 20. The researcher needs to be able to ﬁx the
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000145">145</pagenum>

<h1>
	   page no: 145
</h1>

<p>
	sample size within reasonable limits, therefore, the uncontrolled random sampling of clusters with
unequal sizes, e. g., cities, blocks in big cities, districts, villages and establishments is not suitable.
</p>


<p>
		 Exact control of sample size is unnecessary and impossible in most situations. However, the
least an approximate contrOl is essential. The main reasons for controlling sample size are:

1. The sample should be of adequate size in order to get results of desired degree of precision.

2. The cost of data collection requires an upper limit on the overall sample size, and contractual
   obligation, if any, may also impose a lower limit.10

3. Large differences and fluctuations 1n the size of clusters cause administrative inefficiencies
   in the field work.11

4. Statistical efficiency tends to suffer from large inequalities of sample clusters.12 If the random  sample of clusters includes one or two very large clusters containing mostly one social, ethnic group, the survey results would become biased.
</p>

 <p>
	 For several such reasons a reasonable control over the sample size is needed. There are some
ways to control and decrease variations in ultimate sample size viz.,

   1. Stratification of clusters by size and selecting a random sample in each size- group;

   2. Splitting and combining natural clusters to form artificial clusters of more or less equal size; or
   3. Selecting clusters with probability proportional to size (PPS) either from the overall frame
      of clusters or from each size group of clusters.
</p>

<h1>
	Sampling with Probability Proportionate Size (PPS)
</h1>

  <p>
	 The procedure of selecting clusters with probability proportional to size (PPS) is widely used.
If one primary cluster has twice as large a population as another, it is given twice the chance of being
selected. If the same number of persons is then selected from each of the selected clusters, the overall
probability of any person will be the same. The PPS is a better method for securing a representative sample of population elements in multi stage cluster sampling.
</p>

<p>
	The selection procedure is as follows:

  1. Draw a list of clusters with their size measures;

  2. Cumulate the size measures in sequences,


  3. Divide the list into a certain appropriate number of equal zones/ strata with reference to
    cumulated measure, e. g, if the cumulative total 1s say 600, the list may be divided into three
     equal zones 1-200, 201-400, 401 -600;

  4. Select the required equal number of sample in each zone, applying preferably systematic
     selection with. a random start; and

  5 . Draw a same fixed number of population elements from each selected cluster at random.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000146">146</pagenum>

 <h1>

</h1>

<p>

	Illustration. Suppose the area of a survey is a State consisting of 20 districts. Out of them 4
districts are to be selected with PPS, the measure of size being population. "

(a) List the district in some order and record the population of each together with cumulative
population figures. (See Table 6.1);

(b) Divide the cumulative total by 2: 310/2 = 155;

(C) Divide the list into two zones: 1-155; 156-310;

(d) Make a systematic random selection of two districts in each zone;

(e) Divide the first zone total by 2. 155/2: 77. Draw a random number between 1 and 77, say,
   66. The district 8 is the first sample.

(f) Add the interval 77 to the random number of 66 to give- 143, to locate 13 as the second;

(g) Add the interval 77 to 143 to give 220, to locate district 17 as the third sample; and

(h) Add the interval 77 to 220 to give 297, to locate 20 as the fourth sample.
</p>

<p>
Advantages: The major advantages of PPS are:

1. Clusters of various sizes get proportionate representation.

2. PPS lead to greater precision than would a simple random sample of clusters and a constant
   sampling fraction at the second stage.
3. Equal- sized samples fro each selected primary cluster are convenient  for field work. If one
   interviewer is assigned to each cluster, the interviewers have equal workloads.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000147">147</pagenum>


 <h1>
	 page no:147
</h1>

   <p>
	Limitation: PPS cannot be used if the sizes of the primary sampling clusters are not known.
</p>

  <p>
	 Application: Since 1n practice, primary sampling units (clusters) generally vary considerably in
size. sampling with PSS is used in all multistage sampling.
</p>

<h1>
	Double (or Two- Phase) Sampling and Multi-Phase Sampling
</h1>

    <p>
	Double (or Two- Phase) sampling “refers to the subsection of the final sample from a preselected
larger sample, that provide information for improving the final selection.”13 When this procedure 1s
extended to more than two phases of selection, it is then, called Multi- phase sampling. This is also
known as Sequential Sampling, as sub- sampling is done from a main sample in phases. Additional
information ion from sub samples of the full sample may be collected at the same time or later.
</p>

   <p>
	Multi-phase Vs. Multi-stage sampling: Multi-phase sampling is different from multi-stage
sampling. “In multi—phase sampling, the different phases of observation relate to sample units of the
same type while in multi-stage sampling, the sampling units are of different types at different stages. ”14
</p>

 <p>
	 Usage: Double or multi-phase sampling is a compromise solution for a dilemma posed by
undesirable extremes. “The statistics based on the sample of n can be improved by using ancillary
information from a wide base: but this 13 too costly to obtain from the entire population of N elements.
instead, information is obtained from a larger preliminary sample nL which includes the final sample Multi-phase sampling is appropriate.
</p>

  <p>
	When it is more convenient and economical to collect certain items of general information on
the whole of the units of a sample, and other items of special information from a sub-sample of cases possessing a given set of characteristics.
</p>

  <p>
	 For example, in a consumer behaviour study relating to Television, a common set of data may
be collected from a larger sample of households and a set of additional data from those who posses
colour TVs.
</p>

  <p>
	 In multi-phase sampling, the general sample should be larger enough to yield adequate sub-
sample or for detailed investigation.
</p>

   <p>
	 Multi-phase sampling can result in considerable economies and reduce the burden on the
respondents. Moreover, the information collected from the full sample can be used for stratification
purpose in the selection of the sub-sample or for estimating the effect of non-response in the sub-sample.
</p>

    <p>
	Suppose we want a sample of individuals stratified by educational level, but the necessary
information is not available for the population under study. A large first- phase sample may be selected
and information on the educational level of sampled individuals may be collected from them. The
respondents may then be stratified on the basis of educational levels. A sub sample can then be
drawn, using either proportionate or disproportionate stratified sampling.
</p>

 <p>
	 "The use of two phase sampling for the sole purpose of Increasing the precision of sub- sample
results is effective, only if the cost of data collection is considerably lower for members of the
first phase sample than for members of the sub- sample- by. a factor of atleast, say, ten.”16

<h1>
	Replicated or Interpenetrating Sampling
</h1>

<p>
	A real difficulty with complex sample designs like multi-stage stratified sampling is the
laboriousness of the sampling error calculatiOns. The case of these calculations is a factor to be taken
into account in designing of a sample plan. One approach to simplify the procedure of computing
sampling errors is replicated or interpenetrating sampling, which Deming17 discusses in full, with
number of illustrations.
</p>

<p>
	Replicated or Interpenetrating sampling involves selection of a certain number of sub—sample
rather than one full sample from a population. All the sub—samples should be drawn using the same
sampling technique and each is a self-  contained and adequate sample of the population.
</p>

<p>
	Replicated or Interpenetrating sampling can be_ used with any basic sampling technique: sample
or stratified, single or multi- -stage or single or multi- phase sampling.
</p>

<p>
	For example, in order to study the views of postgraduates students of a university on semester
system a random sample of 300 students (out of a total population of 3,000 students distributed over
different disciplines like Economics, Sociology, Statistics, Mathematics, Management etc.,) is to be drawn, adopting discipline- -based stratified sampling.
</p>

<p>
	Instead of selecting one full sample of 300 students, two sub-samples of 150 each, or five sub-
samples of each may be selected. The latter procedure is replicated sampling.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever may be the number and size of sub-samples, each sub-sample has to be an independent
sample with the same sampling method, and must be a sample covering the complete population.
</p>


<p>
	Each sub-sample may be allocated to one individual investigator or a team of investigators.
</p>

<p>
	Sample errors estimates can be calculated for each of the sub-samples, and the variation
between these estimates provide a means of assessing the precision of the overall estimate.
</p>

<p>
	A decision to be made is the number of sub-samples to be drawn. The number may vary between
4 to 10. Mahalanobis 18 often used four replications. If it is desired to obtain simple estimates
of sampling errors, more replications are desirable. For this purpose, Deming has made wide use  of ten of replications.
</p>

<p>
	Advantages: The major advantages of Replicated or Interpenetrating sampling are:

1. It provides a simple means of calculating the sampling error.

2. It is practical. If the size of the total sample is too large to get the results ready in time, one or more of the replications can be used to get the advance results.

3. The replicated sample can throw light on variable non- sampling errors (See Section 6.5 of
   this chapter). If each of the s-ub -sample IS interviewed by a different or set of interviewers,
   an estimation of inter-viewer variation can be obtained.
</p>

<p>
	Disadvantages: A disadvantage of replicated sampling is that it limits the amount of
stratification that can be employed. This limitation IS a real draWback to the use of replicated sampling in a multi- stage sampling plan.

<h1>
	       NON -PROBABILITY SAMPLING METHODS, page no:149
</h1>

<h1>
Introduction
</h1>

   <p>
	 As explained earlier, non- probability sampling does not adopt the theory of probability and it
 does not give a representative sample of the population. The primary methods of non- probability
sampling are:

   Convenience sampling

   Purposive (or Judgement) sampling

   Quota sampling

   Accidental sampling

   Snow-ball sampling
</p>

<h1>
	Convenience or Accidental Sampling
</h1>

    <p>
	This is non- probability sampling. It means selecting sample units in a just ‘hit and miss’ fashion,
e. g., interviewing people whom we happen to meet. This sampling also means selecting whatever
sampling units are conveniently available, e .g., a teacher may select students in his class.
</p>

   <p>
	 This is method is also known as accidental sampling because the respondents whom the researcher
meets accidently are included in the sample.
</p>

  <p>
	 Usefulness: Though convenience sampling has no status, it may be used for simple purpose
such as a testing ideas or gaining ideas or rough impression about a subject of interest. It lays a
groundwork for a subsequent probability sampling. Sometimes it may have to be necessarily used. For
example, when a population cannot be defined or a list of population 18 not available, there is no
other alternative than to use convenient sampling.
</p>

<p>
	Advantages:

1. Convenience sampling is the cheapest and simplest.

2. It does not require a list of population.

3. It does not require any statistical expertise.
</p>

<p>
 Disadvantages:

1.Convenience sampling is highly biased, because of the researcher’s subjectivity, and so it
   does not yield a representative Sample.

2. It is the least reliable sampling method. There IS no way of estimating the representativeness
   of the sample.

3. The findings cannot be generalized.
</p>

<h1>
	Purposive or Judgement Sampling
</h1>

 <p>
	 This method means deliberate selection of sample units that conform to some pre-determined
criteria 15 also known as Judgement sampling. This involves selection of cases which we judge
as the most appropriate ones for the given study. It is based on the judgement of the researcher or
some expert. It does not aim at securing a cross section of a population.
</p>
<p>

  The chance that a particular case be selected for the sample depends on the subjective judgement
of the researcher. For example, a researcher may deliberately choose industrial undertakings in
which
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000150">150</pagenum>

 <h1>
          	page no:150
</h1>

<p>
	quality circles are believed to be functioning successfully and undertakings in which quality
circle are believed to be a total failure.
</p>

<p>
	Application: The method is appropriate when what is important is the typicality and specially
relevance of the sampling units to the study and not their overall representativeness to the
population
</p>

<p>
	Advantages: The advantages of purposive or judgement sampling are:

   1. It is less costly and more convenient.

   2. It guarantees inclusion of relevant elements in the sample. Probability sampling plans" cannot give such guarantee.
</p>

<p>
	Disadvantages: The demerits of judgement sampling are:

  1. This does not ensure the representativeness of the sample.

  2. This is less efficient for generalizing when compared with random sampling.

  3. This method requires more prior extensive information about the population one studies
    Without Such information, it is not possible to adjudge the suitability of the sample item
    to be selected.

   4. This method does not lend itself for using inferential statistics, because, this sampling due
      not satisfy the underlying assumption of randomness.
</p>

<h1>
 Quota Sampling
</h1>

  <p>
	This is a form of convenient sampling involving selection of quota groups of accessible sampling
units by traits such as sex, age, social class, etc. when the population is known to consist of value
categories by sex, age, religion, social class etc., in specific proportions) each investigator may be
given an assignment of quota groups specified by the pre-determined traits in specific proportions. He can then select accessible persons, belonging to those quota groups in the area assigned to him.
</p>

<p>
	 “Quota Sampling is therefore a method of stratified sampling in which selection within start
is non-random. It is this Non—random element that constitutes its greatest weakness.”19
</p>

 <p>
	 Quotas are stratified by such variables as sex, age, social class and religion] It is easy to classify
the accessible respondents under sex, age and religion, but it is very difficult to classify them
social categories, since social class usually involves a combination of factors such as occupation
income and caste and the interviewer’s subjective judgement and bias play some role in the social
class classification of respondents.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000151">151</pagenum>

<h1>
	page no:151
</h1>


<p>
	Application: Quota sampling is used in studies like marketing surveys, opinion polls and
leadership surveys which do not aim at precision, but to get quickly some crude results.
</p>

<p>
  Merits: The major advantages 0f quota sampling are:

   1. It is considerably less costly than probability sampling.

   2. It is takes less time.

   3. There is no need for a list of population. Thus, quota sampling is a suitable method of
      sampling a population for which no suitable frame is available.

   4. Field work can easily be organized. Strict supervision need not be required.
</p>

<p>
	Shortcomings: The method of quota sampling suffers from certain major shortcomings.

  1. It may not yield a precise representative sample, and it is impossible to estimate sampling
error. The findings, therefore, are not generalizable to any significant extent.

  2. Interviewers may tent to choose the most accessible persons; they may ignore slums or areas
 difficult to reach. Thus, they may fail to secure a representative sample Within their quota
 groups.

 3. Strict control of field work is difficult.

 4. It is difficult for sampling on more than three variable dimensions. This 18 because the number
of categories to be selected 18 a multiplication of the number of values 1n each variable. For instances,
if we want to sample proportionate number of persons by sex, social status and age and these variables
consists of two, three and, three categories respectively, we have to select 2 x 3 x 3 = 18
categories of respondent.

 5. The quota of sampling is subject to a higher degree of classification error, because the
investigators are likely to base their classification of respondents’ social status and economic
status mostly on their impressions about them.
</p>

<h1>
	Snow ball Sampling
</h1>

 <p>
	This is the colourful name20 for a technique of building up a list or a sample of a special
population by using an initial set of its members as informants. For example, if a researcher wants
to study the problem faced by Indians through some source like Indian Embassy. Then he can ask
each of them to supply names of other Indians known to them, and continue this procedure until
he gets an exhaustive list from which he can draw a sample or make a census survey.

   This is sampling technique may also be used in socio-metric studies. For example, the members
of a social group may be asked to name the persons with whom they have social contacts, each one
of the person so named may also be asked to do so, and so on. The researcher may thus get a
constellations of associates and analyze it.

   Advantages: The advantages of snowball sampling are:

  1. It is very useful in studying social groups, informal group in a formal organization, and
     diffusion of information among professionals of various kinds.

  2. It IS useful for smaller populations for which no frames are readily available.

<h1>
Disadvantages:
</h1>

<p>
  1. The major disadvantages of snowball sampling is that it does not allow the use of probability
     statistical methods. Elements included are dependent on the subjective choice of the original
     selected respondents.

  2. It is difficult to apply this method when the population is large.

  3. It does not ensure the inclusion of all elements in the list.

<h1>
	       6.3 SAMPLE DESIGN AND CHOICE OF SAMPLING TECHNIQUE
</h1>

<h1>
Sample Design
</h1>

 <p>
	 Sample design is a plan for drawing a sample from a population. This is an important part of
a research design or plan. The preparation of a sample design involves making decisions on the
following questions:
</p>

1. What is the relevant population?

2. What method of sampling frame shall we use?

3. What sampling frame shall we use?

4. What are the parameters of interest?

5. What should be the sample size?

6. How much will be the sample cost?

<h1>
	Relevant Population
</h1>

   <p>
	 The population relevant to a survey depends upon the research problem, the objectives of study
,the geographical area selected for the survey, and the operational definition of the unit of
study.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000153">153</pagenum>


<h1>
	 Sampling Frame, page no:153
</h1>

<p>
	This is the list of population elements from which the sample is drawn. Ideally it should be a
complete and correct list of population elements only. In practice, the sampling frame available may
not meet the requirements of the survey. It may suffer from some shortcomings, giving rise to frame
problems. In Kish’s classification, 21 there are four basic kinds of frame problems. They are:
</p>

<p>
	The first is the problem of non- coverage and incomplete frame For example, the voters list in
a graduates constituency may not contain the names of all eligible graduates due to non-
registration by some graduates; the payroll list of a ﬁrm may not contain the names of newly
recruited employees.
</p>

<p>
	such incomplete frames cannot yield representative samples. One way to deal with the missing
elements in incomplete frames is to prepare a supplementary list of missing items and use that list
as a separate stratum. But if the missing elements belong to different strata, they have to be listed in
the respective strata. However, when such listing is costly, the coverage of the survey may be
limited to the available frame, provided the survey objective permits it.
</p>

<p>
	The second problem is appearing of clusters of elements in lists. This occurs when elements
are listed not individually but in clusters. For example, a list of house numbers available from a
municipal corporation office is only a list of houses and in each house there may be several
individuals or households.
</p>

<p>
  The possible ways of dealing with this problem are:
   1. To take all the elements in the selected clusters, provided the clusters are small

   2. To select one element from each of the selected clusters, at random and to weigh it up with
      number of elements in the cluster.

   3. To take a sample of clusters, list all their elements, and then take a sample of elements from this list.
</p>

<p>
	The third problem is that of blanks or foreign elements. Some of the available lists may contain
no elements of the target population or contain elements not relevant to the target population. For
example, a list of members of a cooperative society may be out—of-date and some of the persons
listed might have died or withdrawn membership or emigrated.
</p> 1

<p>
	The fourth problem is duplicate listing, i. e., elements appearing more than once on the
sampling frame. This problem arises when the sampling frame is made up of a combination of lists
which have
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000154">154</pagenum>

<h1>
	   page no:154
</h1>

<p>
	overlapping memberships. If the additional entries of elements can be removed before selection, the
the problem of duplication can be avoided altogether. Of such removal is expensive, one of the
listings may be chosen to represent the element and the others treated as blanks.
</p>

<p>
	In evaluating a sampling frame, the researcher should be on the look-out for the existence of
any of the above problems. If they are present, he should take appropriate remedial actions.

   If no suitable frame exists, one may have to be Constructed.
</p>

<p>
	Method of sampling: There are various methods of sampling (See Section 6.2, below, for a
detailed discussion). What method should we use? This decision depends on the aim of the study, the
expected degree of accuracy of the survey result, and the sampling costs. For example, if the aim of
the sample survey is to estimate certain population values in terms of ratios, percentages, average
etc., probability sampling is appropriate. Where some broad idea of population values will serve the
purpose, as in the case of market surveys, a non— probability sampling method may be selected. When
the representativeness of the sample IS important, an appropriate type of random sampling is appropriate
This depends upon the nature of universe and its size. For example, if the universe is heterogeneous
and can be classified into a few homogeneous sub- -groups then stratified random sampling method
may be used. (For a detailed discussion, see “Criteria for selecting Techniques”, below in this
section.
</p>

<p>
	Parameters of interest: The specific population parameters to be estimated should be determined
These are apparent from the investigative questions and hypothesis, e. g.,

     The average amount of savings per month.

     The percentage of consumers who prefer a particular brand of a product.

     The average rate of return on capital employed.

     The proportion of family expenditures on recreation.

     The extent of dining out by families.

     The percentage of women who read women’s section in a magazine.

 Such questions determine the sample design, and sample size.
</p>

<p>
	Parameters may be variables or attributes. Variables like rupees, age, length, scores, family
size number of visits per month, etc., are measured by using measures of central tendency and
deviation  techniques. Attributes like interest, opinion, attitude etc., are measured in terms of
percentage of ratio.
</p>

<p>
	Sample size: The size of sample to be drawn depends upon various factors like the population
size, the size of the population dispersion, the acceptable confidence level for the parameter
estimated etc., These are discussed in detail later in this chapter (See Section 6.4 in this Chapter, below).
</p>

<p>
	Sample cost: Cost considerations influence decisions about the method of sampling and the
sample size. Probability sampling involves listing costs, call back costs and other costs. Simple
random sampling is more costly than cluster sampling. The cost per unit may be less when haphazard
methods of sampling are used or when data are collected by mailing questionnaires instead of the
personal interviewing.
</p>

<h1>
	Criteria for Selecting Sampling Techniques
</h1>

<p>
	In the previous Section (6.2) we have examined the various sampling methods— their features
applications and merits and limitations. Now let us examine the criteria for selecting and appropriate
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000155">155</pagenum>

<h1>
	   page no:155
</h1>

<p>
	sampling plan for a given study. The quality of the research output, and the validity of its findings,
among other things, depend upon the appropriateness of the sampling design selected for the study.
The choice of a sampling plan calls for a careful consideration of various factors such as the nature
of the problem, the intention of the researcher, the geographical area covered by the survey, the size
of the population to be studied, the extent of the knowledge available about the population, the
amount of funds and other facilities available for the study, the time factor and the desired
precision or reliability of the results vis- a- vis the relative features and suitability of the
various sampling techniques.
</p>

 <p>
	The decision process is complicated one. The researcher has to first identify the limiting factor
of factors. Time factor, funds or non- a-vailability of preliminary information about it may be limiting
factors. He has to consider the other factors with reference to the limiting factors. Further several
factors conflict. For example, there are conflicts between precision and cost; the scope of the study
and the available funds and time, the area covered and the available funds and time; non- availability
of population list and the researcher’ s intention to generalize the findings based on the sample
survey;
and so on Therefore the researcher must judiciously balance the conflicting factors. The purpose of
the study may call for the application of a particular method, but because of practical
difficulties ,it
may not be possible to adopt it. For example, if the researcher aims at applying inferential statistical
analysis, then probability sampling is essential. But if the nature of the population to be studied is
not known and the sampling frame is not available, it is difficult to apply probability sampling.
Such practical difficulties necessitate a compromise on his part.
</p>

<p>
	Now let us discuss 1n detail the various criteria governing the choice of the sampling technique:
</p>

<p>
	1. Purpose of the survey: What does the researcher aim at? If he intends to generalize the
findings based on the sample survey to the population, then an appropriate probability sampling
method must be selected. The choice of a particular type of probability sampling depends on the
geographical area of the survey and the size and nature of the population under study.

    On the other hand, if he 1s interested 1n just understanding the nature of the phenomenon under
study and does not aim at generalizing his finding, some non- probability sampling method will suffice.
</p>
<p>
	2. Measurability: The application of statistical inference theory requires computation of the
sampling error from the sample itself. Probability samples Only allow such computation. Hence, where
the researcher objective requires statistical inference, the sample should be drawn by applying simple
random sampling method or stratified random sampling method, depending on whether the population
is homogeneous or heterogeneous. All probability samples are non- -measurable, e. g, selecting a single
cluster, a systematic sampling from a population with periodic variation, and cluster sampling in
which the primary clusters are not identified.
</p>

<p>
   3. Degree of precision: Should the results of the survey be very precise, or even rough results
could serve the purpose? The desired level of precision is one of the criteria of sampling method
selections. Where a high degree of precision of results would serve the purpose (e. g., marketing
surveys) any convenient non-random sampling like quota sampling would be enough.
</p>

<p>
  4. Information about population: How much information 1S available about the population to
be studied? Where no lists of population and no information about its nature are available, it is
difficult to apply a probability sampling method.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000156">156</pagenum>

<h1>
	     page no:156
</h1>

<p>
	Then exploratory study with non probability sampling may be made to gain a better idea of the
population. After gaining sufficient knowledge about the populations through the exploratory Study,
appropriate probability sampling design may be adopted.
</p>

<p>
	5. The Nature of the population: In terms of the variables to be studied, is the populations
homogeneous or heterogeneous? In the case of a homogeneous population, even a simple random
sampling will give a representative sample. If the population is heterogeneous, stratified random
sampling is appropriate. “Systematic sampling would, however, be preferred in those cases where the
list of units of population is available or easily obtainable and where there is no periodic
variation or trend present in the population.”22

<p>
	6. Geographical area of the study and the size of the population: If the area covered by a
survey is very large (e. g., a country or a state) and the size of the population is quite large, Multi-
stage cluster sampling would be appropriate. But if the area and the size of the population are
small single stage probability sampling methods could be used.
</p>

<p>
	7. Financial resources: Is the available finance a limiting factor or not? If the available finance
is limited, it may become necessary to choose a less costly sampling plan like multistage cluster
sampling or even quota sampling as a compromise. However, if the objectives of the study and the
desired level of precision cannot be attained within the stipulated budget, there is no alternative than
to give up the proposed survey. Where finance is not a constraint, a researcher can choose the most
appropriate method of sampling that ﬁts the research objective and the nature of population.
</p>

<p>
	8. Time limitation: The time limit within which the research project should be completed
restricts the choice of a sampling method. Then, as a compromise, it may become necessary to choose
less time consuming methods like simple random sampling instead of stratified sampling/ sampling
with probability proportional to size, multi- -stage cluster sampling instead of single -stage sampling of elements. Of course, the precision has to be sacrificed to some extent.
</p>

<p>
	9. Economy Should be another criterion in choosing the sampling method. It means achieving
the desired level of precision at minimum cost. “A sample 1S economical if the precision per unit cost
is high or the cost per unit of variance is low.”23 The precisions and costs of various measurable
probability sampling methods can be compared and the method which achieves the optimal balance
between reliability of results and costs may be selected. This calls for much thought and ingenuity
</p>

<p>
	The above criteria frequently conflict and the researcher must balance and bend them to obtains
a good sampling plan. The chosen plan thus represents an adaptation of the sampling theory to the
available facilities and resources. That 1S, it represents a compromise between idealism and
feasibility. One should use simple workable methods instead of unduly elaborate and complicated techniques.
</p>

<h1>
	Model Sampling Designs
</h1>

<p>
	Model 1: The multi-stage sampling design adopted for the All- India Rural Credit Survey24
conducted by the Reserve Bank of India during 1951-52 (the first large- scale country—wide survey)
is presented below.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000157">157</pagenum>


 <h1>
	     page no:157
</h1>

 <p>
	 The main aim of this survey was“ to identify the broad patterns of the working of agricultural
credit, including cooperative credit in the different regions of the country.
</p>

<p>
	It was decided that the working of rural credit should be studied in relation to two aspects, Viz.,
the demand for credit from rural families and the supply of credit by credit agencies, both institutional
and private; these two aspects are hereafter referred to as the ‘demand’ and ‘supply’ aspects respectively
of the survey. It was decided to treat district as the unit in the investigations connected with both these
aspects and to select as may as 75 districts from all over the country, representative of all the
geographical and other types of regions in the country. It was considered desirable to select the
district on a random basis.
</p>

<p>
	In connection with ‘demand’ aspect of the survey, it was decided that a sample of 600 villages,
at the rate of 8 villages per district, should be selected from the 75 districts, and families in these
villages should be investigated. As one of the main objectives of the survey was to study the working
of cooperative credit in rural areas, it was considered desirable that half the number of villages
 selected should be those in which primary cooperative credit societies existed and the other half
should be those where such societies did not exist.
</p>

<h1>
	Selections of Sample Units
</h1>

<p>
	Selections of districts: The survey was to cover the whole of the rural area of the country
excluding Jammu and Kashmir, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Sikkim, Kutch and the Naga Tribal
area. The 302 districts included 1n the area covered by the survey Served as the frame for the selection
of the sample of 75 districts. In making the selection it was considered desirable that the sample
should be representative of the geographical and agricultural regions in the country. Two factors taken
into consideration for this purpose are the percentage area under cash crops and the percentage area
under irrigation. Subject to considerations regarding these two factors and geographical
representativeness, the selection of the 75 districts was made at random from among the 302
districts.

   The following table gives the average and the standard deviation 1n respect of rural population,
density of population, percentage area under cash crops and percentage area under irrigation, for
the 75 selected districts and for all the districts:
</p>

<p>
	It is seen that the averages and the standard deviations for the sample districts and for all
the district are in close agreement.
</p>



<p>
	Selection of the villages: For the purpose of Selecting a sample of eight villages in each
selected district, lists of the villages together with their population according to the 1951
Census were obtained
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000158">158</pagenum>

<h1>
	 page no: 158
</h1>

<p>
from the Census authorities in the different States. As it was required to select half the number of
villages from among those where primary cooperative credit societies existed, lists of such societies
were obtained from the Registrars of Cooperative Societies in the different states. Using both these
lists, the villages in each district were divided into two groups, namely, those where primary cooperative
credit societies existed and those where no such soCieties existed. From each of these groups four
villages were selected at random, with probability of selection proportional to the population of
the village.
</p>

<p>
	The lists of the villages so selected were ,sent to the investigators and it was found during the
investigation that in some villages where primary cooperative credit societies were reported to be
existing no such society could be located, similarly, in some villages which were reported to be
without cooperative credit societies, such societies were actually found to be existing. Substitutions
were made in several of the cases by selecting fresh villages from each groups. However, it was not
possible to make substitutions in those cases where the reports from the fields staff regarding such
discrepancies were not received at the head office 1n time. Owing to this and also to the fact that is
some districts there were less than four villages with cooperative credit societies, it was not possible
to select exactly four villages with cooperative credit societies and four villages without such societies
in every selected district. Among the 600 Villages selected, 284 villages were with cooperative credit
societies and the remaining 316 were without such societies. The distribution of the 75 districts
according to the number of Selected villages "with primary cooperative credit societies is as shows
below.
</p>

   <p>
	Selection of cultivating families: The information available in the General schedule regarding
the size of the Cultivated holding was used to classify all families in the village into two groups
namely, cultivators and non- cultivators All families who cultivated any land, owned Or leased, excluding
small garden plots, were classified as cultivating families. Owners of tea, coffee and rubber
plantations who did not cultivate Other crops, were not included among cultivators.
</p>

<p>
	For selecting a representative sample of cultivating families all cultivating families in each
selected village were arranged in descending order of the magnitude of the size of their cultivated
holding. The list of cultivating families in each village was then divided into ten deciles with roughly
equal number of families in eaCh decile, the excess of families obtained after dividing the total
number by ten being adjusted by allotting them at the rate of one each to a few randomly selected.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000159">159</pagenum>

<p>
	deciles. For each of the first five deciles one family was selected at random and from each of the last
fives deciles one family was selected at random, thus giving altogether a sample of 15 cultivating
families in each village. In those villages where the total number of cultivating families was less than 15, all the cultivating families were selected.
</p>

<p>
	Model 2: The Multi-stage sampling design25 adopted by Prof. O.R. Krishnaswami for a project
sponsored by the ICSSR entitled ‘Factors affecting economic conditions of agricultural labourers in
Coimbatore District in the context 0f agrarian changes’.
</p>

   The objectives of the study were:

  1. To investigate into the nature of employment, the quantum of work, the wage rates, mode
     of payment, savings and investments and level of living of agricultural labourers in
     Coimbatore district;

 2. To identify the factors affecting the above conditions of labourers and their migration and
    mobility, with particular reference to the role played by the labour organizations (formal or
    informal) and processes and measures like mechanization and modernization of agriculture,
    land reforms, labour legislations and welfare schemes, industrialization and urbanization,
    cropping pattern and extent of irrigation facilities and rural industrialization; and

 3. To suggest measures for improving the conditions of agricultural labourers.

  keeping in mind the requirements of the above objectives, a multistage sampling design was adopted;
</p>

<p>
	Sampling stage I: Selection of Blocks: The first stage sample units were the constituent community
development blocks in the district, numbering in all, forty- one. Two blocks- one with a high degree
of industrialization and urbanization, viz., Perur, situated close to the industrial city of Coimbatore
and the other with a high degree of modernization of agriculture, viz., Thukkenaikenpalayam situated
about 97 kms. Away from Coimbatore city — were selected for the study. The degree of industrialization
and urbanization and degree of modernization of agriculture were used as the sample criteria at this
stage mainly because it was considered that they are among the important external factors which
influence the economic conditions of agricultural labourers. Further only at the block level rather than
at the levels their impact can be studied more profitably. As far as possible the extent of irrigation
facilities cropping pattern and rural industrialization were also considered in the selection of
the sample blocks.
</p>

<p>
	The process of selection of the blocks was neither simple nor quick as we expected at the time
of designing the study; it was more cumbersome and time -consuming. To decide upon the degree of
industrialization  and modernaisation of a block, various particulars like the number of industries, kind
of industries, number of persons employed in industries in the block, distance of the block headquarters
from the major towns and cities in the district, proportion of urban population to rural population and
the number of towns in the block with over 10,000 population were required. All these were not
readily available from any one source in respect of all the blocks in the district. Therefore, through
the District Collector, all the concerned district level officials of the Industries Department and the
Block development Officers were contacted by post for the purpose of collecting the necessary data.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000160">160</pagenum>

<h1>
	    page no: 160
</h1>

<p>
	Only a few had responded to our request. The details supplied even by those few officials were
not up -to- date, complete and reliable in many cases.
</p>

<p>
	In the above circumstances, it was decided to conduct an on—the-spot study of at least those
blocks which are situated around Coimbatore city, i .e., within a radius of 20 kms., and considered as
having been highly industrialized and urbanized in comparison with other blocks. We found that the
opinions of the concerned officials were useful. Accordingly, four blocks viz., Perur (8 kms)
Thondamuthur (14 kms.); Perianaicken Palayam (18 kms.) and Sarkarsamakkulam (19 kms.) were
visited by the project staff. From the ﬁgure collected from the interviews with local officials
leaders and also by observation, it was decided to select Perur block which met more or less all the
requirements of the sample design. This block being located in the industrial belt of the district and
being very proximate of the city of Coimbatore lS supposed to possess a high degree of industrialization and urbanization.
</p>

<p>
	The personal experiences of project staff who had already conducted similar studies in the
region coupled with information received from the four Divisional Agricultural Officers had helped
to select another block with a high degree of modernization of agriculture with assured irrigation
facilities. As such, Thukkanaickenpalayam block which is mostly irrigated by Lower Bhavani project
Canal was chosen for the study. This is the block which topped the list of six selected blocks in terms
of average adoption index covered for an adoption study conducted earlier under the auspices of the
 Research Programmes Committee of the Planning Commission.
</p>

<p>
	Sampling stage II: Selection of Villages. All the constituent villages of the selected blocks
formed the second stage sample units of the study. Ten villages in all —five villages each— from
the selected blocks were selected.
</p>

<p>
	The methodology followed for the selection of the village was also not free from difficulty.
Though Perur block viewed as a whole was highly industrialized, it was not very much true with
each and every hamlet in the block. As a matter of fact, there are some industrial pockets with in
block. So first of all, we selected only such of the panchayat among the nine constituent panchayats
in the block which were highly industrialized and urbanized in relative terms. Secondly, within the
selected panchayats, viz., Ganapathy, Perur, Sanganur, Telungupalayam and Kumarapalayam we
to visit each and every hamlet in order to select the more appropriate sample villages.
</p>

<p>
	In Thukkanaickenpalayam Block also the same types of problems were faced by us. Not all the
villages were equally modernized 1n terms of agriculture. Following a similar method as we used in
Perur block, five villages were selected in this block. As far as possible, care was taken to see that
only Villages with varying degrees of land-labour ratio were included in the sampling process. The
land-labour ratio was used as the criterion for the sampling of the villages in view of its close relation
to the level of economic conditions of the farm workers. The application of this sampling procedure
 was believed to increase considerably the representativeness of the sample villages.
</p>

<p>
	Sampling stage III: Selection of farm families and agricultural labour households. A list of the
farm families and a list of the agricultural labour households were prepared 1n each of the selected
villages by a quick survey. This yielded reliable data on such aspects as size of operational holding
of farmers and type of labour employed, i. e., whether regular or causal, sources of income for
agricultural labourers etc.,
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000161">161</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 page no:161
</h1>

<p>
	Farm families selection: A sample of 100 farm families in all — 10 families from each village
(10x10 - 100) -- were selected for the study by systematic sampling with probability proportional
to area of land holding. This was considered a better procedure than the ordinary systematic selection
of farmers arranged on the basis of the size of holding because the latter procedure was expected
to
result in over-representation to small farmers (more than proportionately to their area) who cannot be to employ much of hired labour.
</p>

<p>
	Accordingly, all the farmers belonging to a given selected village were arranged in an ascending
order of the size of their farm. Then the total area of land of all the farmers was computed. Thirdly,
the farmers were divided into five groups of equal area. And finally the farmers from each stratum
were selected from the list. The systematic random method was used at this stage. In cases where
there was none or only one in a stratum, the gap or shortage was made good by picking up a
substitute from the proceeding or immediate next stratum.
</p>

<p>
	 As the purpose was not to build up any estimation, a sample of fixed number was found to be
appropriate  and convenient.
</p>

<p>
	Agricultural labour households selection: Then, a sample of 400 agricultural labour households—
40 each from the selected villages — (40 x 10 = 400) were selected for the study by using stratified
random sampling procedure. Firstly, the list of agricultural labour households in each village was
divided into two groups, viz., casual and attached labourers. Then by using the table of random
numbers, 10 attached labourers at the most and at least 30 casual labourers from each village were
selected. As far as possible, only those attached labourers who were working with the selected
farmers
were included 1n the study (matched sample). This has helped to collect data more intelligently on
the conditions  of the attached labourers.

                    	6.4 SAMPLE SIZE
</h1>

<h1>
	Introduction
</h1>

  <p>
	 There are some misconceptions about the required size of a sample. One is that sample should
not be less than 10% of the population. This rule, commonly known as the 1/10th rule is not relevant
to large populations. Statisticians can easily illustrate that when a probability sample reaches a certain
size, such as 1,000 its efficiency for estimating population parameters is not much different
compared
with a probability sample of 10,000 or even 1,00,000.
</p>

<p>
	Another misconception is: ‘larger the sample size, greater may be the accuracy of the sample
results. Although an increase in sample size will increase the precision of the sample results, a
large sample size does not guarantee the accuracy of the results.
</p>

<p>
	The sample sample size can be statistically estimated by deciding the required level of accuracy. This
statistical procedure is based on some basic concepts. Let us introduce those concepts.
</p>

<h1>
	Basics concepts Relevant to Sample Size
</h1>

<p>
	Sample, value and population parameter: Suppose there are four students in a specialization
stream, and they have secured 4, 9, 5 and 6 marks respectively in a test. The mean mark of the
population (u). is 6. A sample of 2 is to be drawn for estimating population.
</p>

<p>
	Suppose a random draw gives a sample of 4 and 6. The sample mean is 10 2 = 5 +0. This is taken
as an estimate of the population mean, m. Since in this example, we know that u is 6, it is
possible.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000162">162</pagenum>

 <h1>
	    page no: 162
</h1>

<p>
for us to say that estimate is inaccurate. That IS, the sample mean is not an accurate
estimation of the
population mean. Had the draw given a sample of 5 and 6, the estimate would have been 5.5., which
is very close. Therefore, the accuracy of a sample estimate refers to its closeness to the correct
population value.
</p>

<p>
	In actual situations, the population value is not known, the actual accuracy of the sample
estimate cannot be assessed. However, its probable accuracy can be estimated. This is explained
below.
</p>

<p>
	Sampling distribution of the mean: Let us consider all possible samples of size n=2 that could
be selected from the above population. The possible samples and their means are
</p>


<p>
	The distribution formed by the values of mean derived from a large number of samples drawn
from the same population is called sampling distribution of the mean. The average of the estimates
derived from all possible samples is 36+ 6: 6, which is equal to the population mean m.
</p>

<p>
	Before proceeding further, let us examine the characteristics of a sampling distribution of the
mean:

(1) The sampling distribution of the mean approximates a normal curve. By arranging sample
    means in a frequency polygon, we end up with the form of a normal curve.

(2) The mean of a sampling distribution of the mean (i. e., the mean of the means) is equal to
    the true population mean. In the above illustration, the average of means of all possible
    samples is 6, which is equal to the population mean.

(3) The standard deviation of a sampling distribution of the mean is smaller than the standard
    deviation of the population.
</p>

<p>
	The variability of the sampling distribution is always smaller than the variability of the
entire population. This is true because the mean scores eliminate extreme raw- score values.
</p>

<p>
	The average of the estimates of a population parameter derived from an infinite number of
samples of the sample population is called the expected value of the estimator (denoted by ‘m’). the
estimator is different from an estimate. While an estimate is the value obtained for a specific
sample, the estimator is the average of the estimates.
</p>

<p>
	If the expected value of the estimator is equal to the population value (as 1n the above illustration),
the estimator is unbiased. If not, it is biased. The difference between the expected value and the
true population value is called the bias. This would be the case where the larger values of the
population.

	Units are used to estimate 11 (statistical symbol), e. g., the expected value of the larger in the above marks in the above illustration is
</p>

<p>
	Any one sample may give an inaccurate estimate on the population and the deviation may be
positive  or negative. But, on an average, the sample estimates are equal to the population value.
</p>

 <p>
	Standard deviation: In practice, a researcher does not draw several samples from a population.
He estimates the population parameter (1.1) on the basis of only one sample. As any two samples are
likely to produce different estimates, is it not a risky procedure to estimate the m from one sample?
It is not because one can estimate from any one random sample how big the differences (sampling
Functions) are likely to be on average. What is needed is a measure to indicate the spread of the
sampling  distribution. The most common measure of the spread of any distribution is the standard
deviation (or its square, the variance).
</p>

<p>
	Standard deviation is the square root of the mean of the squares of the deviation of individual
items from their arithmetic mean. This is represented by a formula:
</p>

 <p>
	 This measure is called the standard error of the mean. Of course, standard error may be computed
for other statistics like the median, proportion, etc.
</p>

<p>

  The standard error serves as a criterion for evaluating the probable accuracy of any one estimate. This may be denoted by S.E.

<p>
	Samples size and variability in the population: In the formula (6.2), we note that the standard
errors is based on two factors:

  (1) The value of ‘n’ i. e., sample size

  (The formula shows that the standard error varies inversely to the square root of ‘n’, i.. e., to
halve the standard error requires four times a big sample. Thus larger the sample size, greater
will be  precision of the results) and

 (2) The value of ‘S’ or O i. e., the variability in the population

 (This also corresponds to the above position. If the variability in the population 18 less, standard
deviation  will be smaller. If, on the other hand, the variability is more, the standard error will be larger).
</p>

 <p>
	Standard deviation of a trait: In practice, the value of ‘S’ is almost unknown. So one has to
substitute for S, the standard deviation of a trait (e. g., marks secured/ age /income etc). In the population
calculated from the sample (to be denoted by ‘s’ and then estimate the standard error from Formula
</p>

<p>
	Interpretation of a standard error: How is an estimate of standard error to be interpreted?
Suppose we have a sample of 150 students and their average mark in a test is 21 and the calculated
's' is 12; then the standard error of the mean is:
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000166">166</pagenum>

</h1>

<p>
	(the f.p.c. is ignored). What does this figure tell us about the precision of the sample estimate?
are interested in the probability that the sample mean falls in any particular range of the sample
distribution. Therefore, before the standard error concept can be utilized, we should know about
shape of the sampling distributions and about the concept of “confidence” range of the sampling
distribution. Therefore, before the standard error concept can be utilized, we should know about
shape of the sampling distributions and about the concept of “confidence or probability levels".
</p>

<p>
	Normal distribution: The distribution of sample means or any other statistic approximated
the normal distribution. Suppose we draw several samples of‘ n’ size out of say 1,000 students and
estimate the mean ages of those samples, then the sample distribution is shown as under.
</p>

<p>
	With reasonably large samples; the sampling distribution of any statistic approximates to
normal distribution. What are the characteristics of a normal distribution?
</p>

<p>
	Normal distribution is distributed symmetrically about its mean with a large number of small
deviations from the mean and a few large ones. If its standard deviation (SD) or o is calculated a
perpendicular lines are drawn at a distance one SD on either side of the mean, then we know that
area enclosed between these lines will comprise approximately 68% of the total area under the
Similarly the area between lines drawn at 2 SD either side of the mean is approximately 95% of
whole; the area between the mean and 2.6 SD on either side approximately 99% of the whole
</p>

<p>
	Confidence levels: The relevance of the above description is: If a particular distribution
approximated normal one, we can say that about 68% of the sample estimates will lie between
mean and one standard error; about 95% between its mean and twice the standard error, about 99
between its mean and 2. 6 standard errors, and so on.
</p>

<p>
	Since the grand mean of all sample means is the best estimate of the population mean, we
 say that the true population mean will fall within the range of sample mean i one SD, 68% of
time; of sample mean i SD, 95% of the time, and of sample i 2.6 SD, 99% of the time. These inter
estimates are called confidence levels, because we say that we are 95% confident that the
population mean lies within the range of two standard errors of the sample mean, and 99% Confidence
that it lies within the range of 2.6 standard errors of the sample mean.

<p>
	Now we can deal with the sample size.
</p>

<h1>
	Estimation of Sample Size
</h1>

<p>
   If cost and other practical limitations do not enter into the decision of the sample size, there is no difficulty in determining the required size.
</p>

<p>
	If the ratio of the calculated sample size (n) to population size (N) is large, i. e., when n/N
	is 0.20 or greater, the finite population correction should be included. Then the final sample
	size (n) is determined by
</p>

<p>
	The reason for including f. p. c. is: If the ratio of an n/N is small, the standard error would
large: If the ratio is one, 1 e the sample IS 100% of the population, the standard error would be zero.
</p>

<p>
	In order to calculate the sample size n we have to decide how big a standard error can be
tolerated. Let us suppose we want to draw a random sample from a population of 10,000 units. The estimated S2 =0.20 and we desire that the standard error should be more than 0.016, then the required sample size is
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000168">168</pagenum>

</h1>

<h1>
	Practical Difficulties
</h1>

    <p>
	Formula (6.4) and (6.5) illustrate the principle involved in estimating the sample size. In
practice, the decision on sample size is more complicated.
</p>

   <p>
	The first difficulty is about the precision required. The researcher must decide the sub-group
extent of precision of the sample results, i.e., how large a standard error he can tolerate.
</p>

   <p>
	Second, the researcher must consider the way the results are to be analyzed, i. e., the sub
   -groups into which the sample muSt be divided. He can then work out roughly the numbers needed
in each sub- -groups to give the desired precision for it.
</p>

   <p>
	Third, the number of variables (or attributes) to be studied should be determined. A sample that
is adequate for one variable may be inadequate for another which requires precision.
</p>

  <p>
	 Fourth, in order to use formula (6.2), the researcher needs an estimate of S. the estimation of
S is often somewhat more difficult. However, an approximate idea about the proportion of the given
trait in the population will be adequate, for moderate errors in estimating this proportion will
have only 2; small effect on the calculation of sample size.

<h1>
	            6.5 SAMPLING AND NON- SAMPLING ERRORS
</h1>

<h1>
	Introduction
</h1>

     <p>
	A survey aims at estimating or inferring selected population characteristics or parameter by
studying either the entire population or a sample of the population. The research results may differ
from the ‘true values’ of the parameters under study. Such differences are known as Errors and biases.
</p>

<p>
	The errors of a survey may be classified into (a) Sampling errors, (b) Sampling biases, (c) No- sampling errors and (d) Non sampling biases.
</p>

<h1>
	Sampling Errors
</h1>
<p>
	The errors which arise because of studying only a part of the total population are called sampling
errors. These may arise due to non— representativeness of the samples and the inadequacy of sample
size. When Several samples are drawn from a population, their results would not be identical. The
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000169">169</pagenum>

<h1>
	     page no: 169
</h1>

<p>
degree of variations of sample results is measured by standard deviation (as explained in the previous
section 6. 4) and it is known as the standard error of the concerned statistic. As sample size increases
the magnitude of the error decreases. Sample size and sampling error are thus negatively correlated
(see Exhibit 6.5).
</p>

<h1>
	Sampling Biases
</h1>

  <p>
	 The average of the estimates of a population parameter derived from an infinite number of
Samples is called the expected value of the estimator (See Section 6.4). The difference between this
value and ‘true value’ of the parameter is the bias. Bias may arise (1) if the sampling is done by a
non-random method, (2) if the sampling frame is incomplete or inaccurate and (3) if some sections
of the population are not available/ refuse to cooperate. Any of these factors will cause non— compensating
errors which cannot be reduced by an increase in sample size. The only sure way of avoiding bias
arising through the sampling method is to use a random method.27 Randomness is an essential part
of the protection against selection bias.
</p>

<h1>
	Non- sampling Errors
</h1>

 <p>
	 These are errors which arise from Sources other than sampling. They include errors of observation,
errors of measurement and errors of responses. Data are collected through the methods of observation
of interviewing. The physical procedures of observation or interviewing are subject to imperfection
which cause errors. Measurement errors consist of error in processing and analysis. Errors of response
include incorrect responses of the respondents, mistakes in noting their responses etc.
</p>

<h1>
	Non -Sampling Biases 28
</h1>

 <p>
	 These biases pose problems for scientific measurement. They affect both the population sample
values and account for the difference between the population value and the true value. They consist
of biases of observation and non- observation, response biases and process biases. Biases of observation
are caused by obtaining and recording observations incorrectly. Non- observation biases arise from
failure to obtain observations on some segments of the population due to either non- coverage or non
response. The latter may be due to refusals, non-at-homes, lost forms, etc. response biases consist of
biases arising from imperfections in field observations or interviewing. Processing biases are
produced during coding, tabulating and computing.
</p>

<h1>
	Total Error
</h1>

<p>
	In sampling theory, a popular model combines sampling and non— sampling errors and biases into
the Total Error. This total error is the square root of the sums of squares of variable errors and
squares of bias. It is often called the root means square error (RMSE).
</p>


<p>
	The variable errors are caused only by sampling errors, and VE equals the standard error of
Sampling Bias is mostly caused by measurement biases (i. e., non- sampling errors).
</p>

<p>
  The total error depends on the length of both of the legs. The sampling error/ standard error leg
can be shortened by improving the sample design and by increasing the sample size. The length of
</p>

 <h1>
	   page no: 170
</h1>

<p>
biases leg may be reduced by improving the tool of data collection, the precision of methods of data
collection, field work, coding, processing and analysis.
</p>

<p>
    The measurement of sampling error does not pose much problem but the measurement of non-
sampling errors require special procedures and it is a costly effect. Hence, the reduction of non-
sampling error is a challenge to the researchers.

</h1>

<h1>
	Meaning of Data
</h1>

   <p>
	The search for answers to research questions is called collection of data. Data are facts, and
other relevant materials, past and present, serving as bases for study and analyses. Some example of
data are:

    The types of Loans secured by borrowers (for a credit survey)

    The items of raw materials required for a product line (Materials management)

    The quantity of each material required for a unit of output

    The sex, age, social class, religion, income level of respondents in a consumer behaviour
    study

    The opinions of eligible couples on birth control devices (Family Planning Survey)

    The capital expenditure proposals considered by a ﬁrm during a year (Financial Management)

    The marks obtained by students of a class in a test on a particular subject (Performances
    of students)

    The opinions of people on voting in a general election (Opinion Poll)

    The types of news read by newspaper readers (Readership Survey)

    The aspirations of management trainees (The emerging Managers in Indian enterprises)

    The types and frequency of breakdowns occurred in particular brand of scooter (Post-
     purchase Behaviour Survey) and so on.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000174">174</pagenum>

<h1>
    Types of Data, page no:174
</h1>

<p>
    The data needed for a social science research may be broadly classified into (a) Data pertaining
to human beings, (b) Data relating to organizations, and (c) Data pertaining to territorial areas.
</p>

<p>
	Personal data or data related to human beings consist of-

(1) Demographic and socio-economic characteristics of individuals: Age, sex, race, social
class, religion, martial status, education, occupation, income, family size, location of the
households life style, etc.,

(2) Behavioural variables: Attitudes, opinions, awareness, knowledge, practice, intentions, et.,
Organizational data consist of data relating to an organization’s origin, ownership, objectives, resources, functions, performance and growth
</p>

  <p>
	 Territorial data are related to geophysical characteristics, resources endowment, population,
occupational pattern, infrastructure, structure, degree of development, etc. of spatial divisions like  villages, cities, talukas, districts, state and the nation.
</p>

<h1>
	Importance of data
</h1>

 <p>
	The data serve as the bases or raw materials for analysis. Without an analysis of factual data,
no specific inferences can be drawn on the questions under study. Inferences based on imagination
or guess work cannot provide correct answers to research questions. The relevance, adequacy and
reliability of data determine the quality of the findings of a study.
</p>

<p>
	Data form the basis for testing the hypotheses formulated in a study. Data also provide the
facts and figures required for constructing measurement scales and tables, which are analyzed with
statistical techniques. Inferences on the results of statistical analysis and tests of significance provide
the answers to research questions. Thus, the scientific process of measurements, analysis, testing and
inferences depends on the availability of relevant data and their accuracy. Hence, the importance of data for nay research study.
</p>

<h1>
	                      7.2 SOURCES OF DATA
</h1>

<p>
	The sources of data may be classified into (a) primary sources. and (b) secondary sources.-
</p>

<h1>
	Primary Sources
</h1>

<p>
   Primary sources are original sources from which the researcher directly collects data that have
not been previously collected, e.g., collection of data directly by the researcher on brand awareness
brand preference, brand loyalty and other aspects of consumer behaviour from a sample of consumers
by interviewing them. Primary data are ﬁrst-hand information collected through various methods such
as observation, interviewing, mailing etc. (Sec. 7.4 Methods of Collecting Primary Data, below).
</p>

<h1>
	Secondary Sources
</h1>

<p>
    These are sources containing data which have been collected and compiled for another purpose
The secondary sources consists of readily available compendia and already compiled statistical
statements and reports whose data may be used by researches for their studies, e.g, census reports
annual reports and financial statements of companies, Statistical statements, Reports of Government
Departments, Annual Reports on currency and finance published by the Reserve Bank of India
Statistical Statements relating to Cooperatives and Regional Rural Banks, published by the NABARD,

<p>
	Reports the National Sample Survey Organization, Reports of trade associations, publications of
international organizations such as UNO, IMF, World Bank, ILO, WHO, etc., Trade and Financial
Journals,  Newspapers, etc.,
</p>

   <p>
	 Secondary sources consists of not only published records and reports, but also unpublished
records. the latter category includes various records and registers maintained by firms and organizations,
e.g., accounting and financial records, personnel records, register of members, minutes of meetings, inventory records, etc.
</p>

    <p>
	Features of Secondary Sources: Though secondary sources are diverse and consist of all sorts
of materials, they have certain common characteristics.
</p>

  <p>
	First, they are ready made and readily available, and do not require the trouble of constructing
tools and administering them.
</p>

 <p>
	 Second, they consist of data over which a researcher has no original control over collection and
classification. Both the form and the content of secondary sources are shaped by others. Clearly, this is a feature which can limit the research value of secondary sources.
</p>

  <p>
	 Finally, secondary sources are not limited in time and space. That is, the researcher using them
need not have  been present when and where they were gathered.
</p>


 <h1>
	                         7.3 USE OF. SECONDARY DATA
</h1>

<h1>
	Uses
</h1>

 <p>
	The Secondary data may be used in three ways by a“ researcher. First, some specific information
from secondary sources may be used for reference purpose. For example, the general statistical
information in the number of cooperative credit societies in the country, their coverage of villages,
their capital structure, volume of business, etc. may be taken from published reports and quoted as
background information 1n a study on the evaluation of performance of cooperative credit societies
in a selected district/ state.
</p>

   <p>
	 Second, secondary data may be used as bench marks against which the findings of a research
may be tested, e.g., the findings of a local or regional survey may be compared with the national
averages; performance indicators of a particular bank may be tested against the corresponding
indicators of the banking industry as a whole; and so on.
</p>

   <p>
	Finally, secondary data may be used as the sole source of information for a research project.
such studies as securities Market Behaviour, Financial Analysis of Companies, Trends in credit
allocation in commercial banks, Sociological Studies on crimes, historical studies, and the like depend
primarily on secondary data. Year books, statistical reports of government departments, report of
public organizations of Bureau of Public Enterprises, Census Reports etc. serve as major data
sources for such research studies.
</p>

<h1>
	advantages
</h1>

<p>
	1. Secondary data, if available can be secured quickly and cheaply. Once their source of
  documents and reports are located, collection of data is just a matter of desk wOrk. Even
  the tediousness of copying the data from the source can now be avoided, thanks to xeroxing
  facilities.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000176">176</pagenum>

<h1>
	        page no:176
</h1>

<p>
2. Wider geographical area and longer reference period may be covered without much one
   Thus, the use of Secondary data extends the researcher’s space and time reach.

3. The use of Secondary data broadens the data base from which scientific generalizations can
   be made. This is especially so when data from several environmental and cultural setting
   are required for the study.

4. The use of Secondary data enables a researcher to verify the findings based on primary data
   It readily meets the need for additional empirical support. The researcher need not await the
    time when additional primary data can be collected.
</p>

<h1>
		Disadvantages/ Limitations
</h1>

<p>
	THe use of secondary data has its own limitations:

1. The most important limitation is the available data may not meet our specific needs. The
   definitions adopted by those who collected those data may be different; units of measure
   may not match; and time periods may also be different.

2. The available data may not be as accurate as desired. To assess their accuracy we need to
   know how the data were collected.

3. The Secondary data are not uptodate and become obsolete when they appear in print.
   because of time lag in producing them. For example, population census data are published
   two or three years later after compilation, and no new figures will be available for another
   ten years.

4. Finally information about the whereabouts of sources may not be available to all social
   scientists. Even if the location of the source is known, the accessibility depends primarily
  on proximity. For example, most of the unpublished official records and compilations are
   located in the capital city, and they are not within the easy reach of researchers based in
   far off places.
</p>

<h1>
	Evaluation of Secondary Data
</h1>

<p>
	When a researcher wants to use secondary data for his research, he should evaluate them before
deciding to use them.

    Data pertinency: The first consideration in evaluation is to examine the pertinency of the
available secondary data to the research problem under study. The following questions. should be
considered;

 1. What are the definitions and classifications employed? Are they consistent with our own?

 2. What are the measurements of variables used? What is the degree to Which they conform
   to the requirements of our research?

3. What is the coverage of the secondary data 1n terms of topic and time? Does this coverage
   ﬁt the needs of our research?

   On the basis of, above consideration, the pertinency of the secondary data to the research or
band should be determined. As researcher who is imaginative and flexible may be able to redefine
his research problem so as to make use of otherwise unusable available data.

 <p>
	Data quality: If the researcher is convinced that the available secondary data ﬁt his needs,
the next step is to examine the quality of the data.

    The quality of data refers to their accuracy, reliability and completeness.
</p>

<p>
	The assurance and reliability of the available secondary data depends on the organization which
collected them and the purpose for which they were collected. What is the authority and prestige of
the organization? Is it well recognized? Is it noted for reliability? It it capable of collecting reliable
data? Does it use trained and well qualified investigators? The answers to these questions
determine the degree of confidence we can have in the data and their accuracy.
</p>

<p>
	It is important to go to the original source of the secondary data rather than to use an immediate
Sources which has quoted from the original. Then only, the researcher can review the. cautionary
and other comments that were made in the original source.
</p>

<p>
	 The completeness refers to the actual coverage of the published data. This depends on the
methodology and sampling design adopted by the original organization. Is the methodology sound?
Is the sample size small or large? Is the sampling method appropriate? Answers to these questions
may indicate the appropriateness and adequacy of the data for the problem under study.
</p>

<p>
	The question of possible bias should also be examined. Whether the purpose for which the
original organization collected the data had a particular orientation? Has the study been made to
promote the organization’s own interest? How the study was conducted? These are important clues.
</p>

<p>
    The researcher must be on guard when the source does not report the methodology and sampling
design. Then it is not possible to determine the adequacy of the secondary data for the  researcher’s study.

<h1>
	       7.4 METHODS OF COLLECTING PRIMARY DATA: GENERAL.
</h1>

<h1>
     Introduction
</h1>

<p>
	Primary data are directly collected by the researcher from their original sources. In this case, the
researcher can collect the required data precisely according to his research needs, he can collect them
when he wants them and 1n the form he needs them. But the collection of primary data 18 costly and
time consuming. Yet, for several types of social science research required data are not available
from secondary sources and they have to be directly gathered from the primary sources.
</p>

<p>
	In such cases where the available data are inappropriate, inadequate or obsolete, primary data
have to be gathered. They include: socio- e—conomic surveys, social anthropological studies of rural
communities and tribal communities, sociological studies of social problems and social institutions,
marketing research, leadership studies, Opinion polls, attitudinal surveys, readership, radio listening
and T.V. viewing surveys, knowledge- awareness practice (KAP) studies, farm management studies,
 business management studies, etc.,
</p>

<h1>
Methods of Primary Data Collection
</h1>

<p>
	 There are various methods of data collection. A ‘Method’ is different from a ‘Tool’. While a
methods refers to the way or mode of gathering data, a tool is an instrument used for the method. For
example, a schedule is used for interviewing. The important methods are (a) observation, (b)
interviewing, (c) mail survey, (d), experimentation, (e) simulation, and (f) projective technique. Each
of these methods is discussed in detail in the subsequent sections in this chapter (see 7.5- 7.11).
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000178">178</pagenum>

<h1>
	       page no: 178
</h1>

 <p>
	 Observations involves gathering of data relating to the selected research by viewing and or
listening. Interviewing involves face-to-face conversation between the investigator and the respondent
Mailing is used for collecting data by getting questionnaires completed by respondents. Experimentation
involves a study of independent variables under controlled conditions. Experiments may be conducted
in a laboratory or in field in a natural setting. Simulation involves creation of an artificial situations
similar to the actual life situation. Projective methods aim at drawing inferences on the characteristics
of respondents by presenting to them stimuli. Even method has its advantages and disadvantages (See
sections 7.5 to 7.13 below).
</p>

<h1>
	Choice of Methods of Data Collection
</h1>

<p>
	Which of the above methods of data collection should be selected for a proposed research
project? This is one of the questions to be considered while designing the research plan. One or more
methods has/ have to be chosen. The choice of a method or methods depends upon the following
factors:

1. The nature of the study of the subject- matter: If it is a study of opinions/ preference of
   persons, interviewing or mailing may be appropriate depending on the educational level of
   the respondents. On the other hand, an impact study may call for experimentation; and a
   study of behavioural pattern may require observation.

2. The unit of enquiry. The unit of enquiry may be an individual, household institution or
   community. To collect data from households, interviewing is preferable. Data from institution
    may be collected by mail survey and studies on communities call for observational method.

3. The size and spread of the sample: If the sample is small and the area covered is compact
    interviewing may be preferable, but a large sample scattered over a wider area may require
    mailing.

4. Scale of the survey: A large scale may require mailing or interviewing through trained
    investigators.

5. The educational level of respondents: For a simple survey among educated persons
   concerned with the subject —matter of study, a mail survey may be appropriate. But for a
    survey of less educated/ illiterate persons like industrial workers, slum dwellers, rural
    people, interviewing is the only suitable method.

6. The type and depth of information to be collected: For collection of general, simple
    factual and non emotional data, interviewing or mailing is appropriate. For an indepth
   survey of personal experiences and sensitive issues, indepth interview is essential.  For
   collection of data on behaviour, culture, customs, life style etc., observational method
    required.

7. The availability of skilled and trained manpower: In this case, even for a large general
    survey entailing many complicated questions, interviewing can be adopted.

8. The rate of accuracy and representative nature of the data required: Interviewing is the
    most appropriate method for collecting accurate data from a representative sample of
    population. Interviewing can achieve a higher response rate.
</p>

  <p>
	 A researcher can select one or more of the methods keeping in view the above factors. No
method is universal. Each method’s unique features should be compared with the needs and conditions
of the study and thus the choice of the methods should be decided.

 <h1>
	 Evaluation of Data Collection Methods  page no:179
</h1>

<p>

     The appropriateness of a method of data collection may be evaluated on the basis of the
following criteria:

1. The efficiency i. e., the speed and cost of data collection,

2. Data quality and adequacy i.e., response rate, accuracy and objectivity,

3. Naturalness of setting,

4. Anonymity,

5. Interviewer superviSion,

6. Control of context and question order,

7. Ability to use visual aids,

8. Potential for controlling variables and

9. Dependence on respondent’s reading and writing ability.

<h1>
	             7.5 OBSERVATION
</h1>

<h1>
Meaning and Importance
</h1>
<p>

    Observation means viewing or seeing. We go on observing something or other while we are
awake. Most of such observations are just casual and have no specific purpose. But observation in
a method of data collection is different from such casual viewing.
</p>
<p>

  Observation may be defined as a systematic viewing of a specific phenomenon in its proper
setting for the specific purpose of gathering data for a particular study. Observation as a method
includes both ‘seeing’ and ‘hearing’. It is accompanied by perceiving as well.
</p>

 <p>
	 Observation is a classical method of scientific enquiry. The body of knowledge of various
natural and physical sciences such as biology, physiology, astronomy, plant ecology etc has been
built upon centuries of systematic observation.
</p>

  <p>
	 Observation also plays a major role in formulating and testing hypothesis in social sciences.
Behavioural scientists observe interactions in small groups; anthropologists observe simple societies,
and small communities; political scientists observe the behaviour of political leaders and political
institutions. In a sense, as the Webs1 have pointed out, all social research begins and ends with
observation. A reSearcher silently watching a city council or a trade union committee or quality circle
or a departmental meeting or a conference of politicians or others picks up hints that help him to
formulate new hypothesis. He can test them through further observation and study.
</p>

 <p>
	 Observation becomes scientific, when it (a) serves a formulated research purpose, (b) is planned
deliberately ,(c) is recorded systematically, and (d) is subjected to checks and controls on validity and
reliability .Validity refers to the extent to which the recorded observations accurately reflect the
construct they are intended to measure. Validity IS assessed by examining how well the observations
agree with alternative measures of the same construct. Reliability entails consistency and freedom
form  measurement error. This is usually assessed in terms of (a) the extent to which two or more
independent observers agree in their ratings of the. same event; and (b) the repeatability of observations
overs time by means of test-retest comparisons. (For detailed discussion see section 5.6 of Chapter 5).
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000180">180</pagenum>


<h1>
	 Characteristics, page no:180
</h1>

<p>
	Observations as a method of data collection has certain characteristics.

1. It is both a physical and a mental activity. The observing eye ‘catches’ many things which
   are slighted, but attention is focused on data that are pertinent to the given study.

2. Observation is selective. A researcher does not observe anything and everything, but selects
the range of things to be observed on the basis of the nature, scope and objectives of his
study. For example, suppose a researcher desires to study the causes of city road accidents
and has formulated a tentative hypothesis that accidents are caused by violation of traffic
rules and overspeeding. When he observes the movements of vehicles on the road, many
things are before his eyes: the type, make, size and colour of the vehicles, the persons sitting
in them, their hair style, etc. All such things which are not relevant to his study are ignored
and only overspeeding and traffic violations are keenly observed by him.

3. Observation is purposive and not casual. It 1s made for the specific purpose of noting things
relevant to the study.

4. It captures the natural social context in which persons behaviour occurs.

5. It grasps the significant events and occurrences that affect social relations of the participants

6. Observation should be exact and be based on standardized tools of research such as
   observation schedule, social- metric scale, etc., and precision instruments, if any.
</p>

<h1>
	Types of Observation
</h1>

<p>
	Observation may be classified in different ways. With reference to investigator’s role, it may  be
classified into (a) participant observation, and (b) non—participant observation. In terms of mode of
observation, it may be classified into (c) direct observation and (d) indirect observation. With reference
to the rigor of the system adopted, observation is classified into (e) controlled observation, and
(f) uncontrolled observation.
</p>

     <p>
	Participant observation: In this observation, the observer is a part of the phenomenon or group
which is observed and he acts as both an observer and a participant. For example, a study of tribal
customs by an anthropologist by taking part in tribal activities like folk dance. The persons who are
observed should not be aware of the researcher’s purpose. Then only their behaviour will be ‘natural’
The concealment of research objective and researcher’s identity is justified on the ground that it
makes it possible to study certain aspects of the group’s culture which are not revealed to outsiders.
</p>

<p>
	Advantages: The advantages of participant observation are:

(1) The observer can understand the emotional reactions of the observed group, and get a
   deeper insight of their experiences. ’

(2) The observer will be able to record context which gives meaning to the observed behaviour
    and heard statements.
</p>

<p>
	Disadvantages: Participant observation suffers from some demerits.

1. The participant observer narrows his range of observation. For example, if there is a hierarchy
   of power in the group/ community under study, he comes to occupy one position within it,
   and thus other avenues of information are closed to him.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000181">181</pagenum>

  <h1>
	    page no:181
</h1>

<p>
2. To the extent that the participant observer participates emotionally, the objectivity is lost.

3. Another limitation of this method is the dual demand made on the observer. Recording can
interfere with participation, and participation can interfere with observation. Recording on
the spot is not possible and it has to be postponed until the observer is alone. Such time. Such
time lag results in some inaccuracy in recording.
</p>

<p>
	Because of the above limitations, participant observation is generally restricted to those cases
where non-participant observation is not practical, e. g., a study of the functioning of a mobile library
or mobile bank or tribal community etc.
</p>

  <p>
	 Non-participant observation: In this method, the observer stands apart and does not participate
in the phenomenon observed. Naturally, there is no emotional involvement on the part of the
observer. This method calls for skill in recording observations in an unnoticed manner.
</p>

 <p>
	 Direct observation: This means observation of an event personally by the observer when it
takes place This method is flexible and allows the observer to see and record subtle aspects of events
and  behaviour as they occur. He is also free to shift places, change the focus of the observation. A
limitation of this method is that the observer’s perception circuit may not be able to cover all relevant
events when the latter move quickly, resulting in the incompleteness of the observation.
</p>

   <p>
	Indirect observation: This does not involve the physical presence of the observer, and the
recording is done by mechanical, photographic or electronic devices, e.g., recording customer and
employee movements by a special motion picture camera mounted in a department of a large store.
This method is less flexible than direct observation, but it is less biasing and less erratic in recording
accuracy. It also provides a permanent record for an analysis of different aspects of the event.
</p>

  <p>
	Controlled observation: This involves standardization of observational techniques and exercise
of maximum control over extrinsic and intrinsic variables by adopting experimental design (see
section 3.8, above) and systematically recording observations (see 7.6 Experimentation, below).

     Controlled observation is carried out either in the laboratory or in the field. It is typified by clear
and explicit decisions on what, how and when to observe. It IS primarily used for inferring causality, and testing causal hypothesis.
</p>

<p>
	Uncontrolled observation: This does not involve control over extrinsic and intrinsic variables.
It is primarily used for descriptive research. Participant observation is a typical uncontrolled
one.
</p>

<h1>
	Planning Observation
</h1>

 <p>
	The use of observation method requires proper planning.

   First, the researcher should carefully examine the relevance of observation method to the data
needs of the selected study.

   Second he must identify the specific investigative questions which call for use of observation
method. These determine the data to be collected.

  Third, he must decide the observation content, viz., specific conditions , events and activities
that have to be observed for the required data. The observation content should include the relevant
variables.

 for each variable chosen, the operational definition should be specified.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000182">182</pagenum>

 <h1>
	   page no:182
</h1>

<p>
	Fifth, the observation setting, the subjects to be observed, the timing and mode of observations
recording, procedure, recording instruments to be used, and other details of the task should be
determined.
</p>

<p>
    Last, observers should be selected and trained. The persons to be selected must have Sufficient
concentration powers, strong memory power and unobtrusive nature. Selected persons should be
imparted both theoretical and practical training.
</p>

<h1>
	 Conditions of Effective Observation
</h1>

<p>
	These conditions consist of:

1. Observations must be done under conditions which will permit accurate results. The observer
must be in vantage point to see clearly the objects to be observed. The distance and the light
must be satisfactory. The mechanical devices used must be 1n good working conditions and
operated by skilled persons.

2. Observation must cover a sufficient number of representative samples of the cases.

3. Recording should be accurate and complete.

4. The accuracy and completeness of recorded results must be checked. A certain number
cases can be observed again by another observer/ another set of mechanical devices, as the
case may be. If it is feasible, two separate observers and sets of instruments may be used
in all or some of the original observations. The results could then be compared to determine
their accuracy and completeness.
</p>

<h1>
	Observation Tools and Recording Devices
</h1>

<p>
	Systematic observation requires the use of observation schedule (or Observationnaire), dairy
and various mechanical recording devices.
</p>

<p>
	Schedule: The data requirements are identified by analyzing the core of the problem. the
objectives of the study, the investigative questions, hypothesis and the operational definition
concepts and out of the data requirements, items of data to be collected through observation
identified. A schedule is then constructed, covering those items of data.
</p>

<p>
	It should be constructed in such a manner as to make it possible to record the necessary
information easily and correctly. Enough space should be provided for recording observation for
each item. The item should appear in logical groupings and in the order in which the observer would
observe them.
</p>

<p>
	Field observation log: This may take the form of a diary or cards. Each item of observation
is recorded under appropriate sub-heading. At the time of observation, rough notings may be made
and at the end of the day, full log may be made. The card system is flexible and facilitates arrangement and re—arrangement of items in any desired order.
</p>

<p>
	Mechanical devices: These may include cameras, tape recorders, videotape and electronics
devices. Still, motion, sound, colour and timelapse cameras give a permanent record of events
Microscopic and telescopic lens may be used in cameras. Eye cameras are common in advertising and
package research. They record eye movements while a consumer is looking at advertisements or
packages. Other recording instruments are: tape, disc, and wire recorders, barometer, hygrometers
speedometers, one-way screens and mirrors, closed-circuit television, light meters, pocket calculators.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000183">183</pagenum>

  <h1>
	 Suitability and Application, page no: 183
</h1>

 <p>
	Observation is suitable for a variety of research purposes. It may be used for studying (a) the
behaviour of human beings and social groups: life styles customs and manner, interpersonal relations,
group dynamics, crowd behaviour, leadership styles, managerial style, other behaviours and actions,
(b) the behaviour of other living creatures like birds, animals etc., (c) physical characteristics of
inanimate things like stores, factories residences, etc, ((1) flow of traffic and parking problems,
(e) movement of materials/products through a plant.
</p>

<p>
	It may be used in exploratory research to gain insights that will be subsequently tested as
hypotheses. It may be used to collect supplementary data that may interpret or qualify findings
obtained by other methods. Observation may be used as the primary method, e.g., anthropological
studies of communities, behavioural studies of small groups.
</p>

   Observation may be used in studying behaviour in ‘natural’ setting or in the laboratory, e.g.,
group information may be studied as it occurs in a real-life situation or in the laboratory room.

<h1>
	  Advantages
</h1>

<p>
	Observation has certain advantages.

1. The  main virtue of observation is its directness, it makes it possible to study behaviour as
it occurs. The researcher need not ask people about their behaviour and interactions, he can
simply watch what they do and say.

2. Data collected by observation may describe the observed phenomena as they occur in their
natural settings. Other methods intrOduce elements or artificiality into the researched situation
for instance, in interview the respondent may not behave in a natural way. There is no such
artificiality in observational studies, especially when the observed persons are not aware of
their being observed.

3. Observation is more suitable for studying subjects who are unable to articulate meaningfully,
   e. g., studies of children, tribal, animals, birds, etc.

4. Observation improves the opportunities for analyzing the contextual background of behaviour.
   Furthermore verbal resorts can be validated and compared with behaviour through observation
   The validity of what men of position and authority say can be verified by observing what
    they actually do.

5. Observation makes it possible to capture the whole event as it occurs. For example, only
   observation can provide an insight into all the aspects of the process of negotiation between
   union and management representatives.

6.  Observation is less demanding of the subjects and has less biasing effect on their conduct
    than does questioning.

7.  It is easier to conduct disguised observation studies than disguised questioning.

8. Mechanical devices may be used for recording data 1n order to secure more accurate data
   and  also of making continuous observations over longer periods.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000184">184</pagenum>

<h1>
	Limitations, page no:184
</h1>


<p>
	Observation cannot be used indiscriminately for all purposes. It has its own limitations

1. Observation is of no use of studying past events or activities. One has to depend upon
   documents or narrations by people for studying such things.

2. It is not suitable for studying opinions and attitudes. However, an observation of related
behaviour affords a good clue to the attitudes, e g., and observation of the seating patterns
of high caste and class persons in a general meeting in a village may be useful for forming
an index of attitude.

3. Observation poses difficulties in obtaining a representative sample. For interviewing and
mailing methods, the selection of a random Sampling can be readily ensured. But observing
people of all types does not make the sample a random one.

4. Observation cannot be used as and when the researcher finds it convenient to use it. He has
to wait for the event to occur. For example, an observation of folk dance of a tribal
community is possible, only when it is performed.

5. A major limitation of this method 1s that the observer normally must be at the scene of the
event when it takes place. Yet it may not be possible to predict where and when the event
will occur, e. g., road accident, communal clash.

6. Observation is a slow and expensive process, requiring human observers and/or costly
surveillance equipments.

<h1>
	                         7.6 EXPERIMENTATION
</h1>

<h1>
	Meaning
</h1>

<p>
	Experimentation is a research process used to study the causal relationships between variables,
It aims at studying the effect of an independent variable on a dependent variable, by keeping the other
independent variable constant through some type of control. For example, a social scientist may use
experimentation for studying the effect of a method of family planning publicity on people’s
awareness of family planning techniques.

    Various kinds of designs such as “after-only design”, “before-after-design”, etc. are used for
experimentation (see 3.8 Experimental Research, above).
</p>

<h1>
	Why Experiment?
</h1>

<p>
	Experimentation requires special efforts. It is often extremely difficult to design, and it is also
a time consuming process. Why should then one take such trouble? Why not simply observe/ survey
the phenomenon? The fundamental weakness of any non- experimental study is its inability to Specify
causes and effect. It can Show only correlations between variables, but correlations alone never
prove
causation. The experiment is the only method which can show the effect of an independent variable
on dependent variable. In experimentation, the researcher can manipulate the independent variable
and measure its effect on the dependent variable. For example, the effect of various types of promotinal
strategies on the sale of a given product can be studied by using different advertising media such
as T. V., radio and Newspapers.
</p>

   Moreover experiment provides “the opportunity to vary the treatment (experimental variable)
systematic manner, thus allowing for the isolation and precise specification of important differences.

<h1>
	Planning and Conducting Experiments
</h1>

   <p>
	It is easy to conceive ideas, but difficult to translate the ideas into a workable, credible, meaningful
set of experimental operations. This to a great extent depends upon the researcher’s knowledge,
imagination and intelligence. Yet the general procedure in experimentation may be outlined.

    First, determine the hypothesis to be tested and the independent and dependent variables inVolved in it.

   Second, operationalize the variables by identifying their measurable dimensions (see section 5.5
concepts in Chapter 5 above.)

   Third, select the type of experimental plan. The types of experimental design based on types of
control may be classified into: (1) one group plan, using the same group as experimental and control
group and measuring it before and after experimental treatment; (2) matched groups plan, consisting
of two identical groups, one to be used as control group and another as experimental group, with
(a) Post- test only measurement or (b) pretest— post -test measurements.

    Fourth, choose the setting. The setting may be field or laboratory (See subsequent paragraphs
for detailed discussion on these two types of experiments).

   Fifth, make the experimental conditions as nearly the same as the expected real life conditions.
, essential in order to make the findings reliable.

  Sixth, make a record of pre-experimental conditions.

  Seventh, introduce appropriate methods for controlling extraneous variables that are not
manipulated in the experiment.
</p>

<p>
	These methods are:
1. Removing the variable: An extraneous variable may be eliminated completely. For example,
   observer distraction may be removed by separating the observer by a one-way glass partition.
   Some variables may be eliminated by selecting cases with uniform characteristics, e.g.,
    using only male subjects removing sex as a variable.

2.Matching cases: Selecting control and experimental groups with identical characteristics.
  By this all variables are kept constant.

3.Balancing cases: This means assigning subjects to experimental and control groups in such
  as way that the means and the variances of the groups are as nearly equal as possible.

4. Randomization: This involves pure chance selection and assignment of subjects to
  experimental and control groups. This method eliminates systematic bias and minimizes the
   effect of extraneous variables.

5. Analysis of covariance. This is a statistical method of eliminating initial differences on
   several variables between the experimental and control groups. Pretest mean scores are used
   as covariates.

</p>

</h1>

      Eighth, apply the experimental treatment and record observations and measurements of
appropriate measurement devices. If feasible, repeat the tests several times in order to insure
accuracy of results.

    Ninth, analyze the results, using appropriate statistical devices.

   Last, interpret the results, giving consideration to all possible extraneous conditions. No post
cause should be overlooked, as unforeseen conditions ‘might influence the results.

<h1>
	Applications
</h1>

<p>
	The applications of experimental method are discussed under ‘Laboratory Experiment
‘Field Experiment’ below.
</p>

<h1>
	Evaluation of Experimental Method
</h1>

<p>
	Experimentation has some specific advantages and disadvantages.

   The advantages are:

1. Its power to determine causal relationships between variables surpasses that of all
methods The influence of extraneous variables can be more effectively controlled in
method.

2. The element of human errors is reduced to the minimum.

3. In this method better conditions for conducting experiments may be created, than is post
in other methods.

4. Fourth, Experimentation yields generally exact measurements and can be repeated for variables
results.
</p>

<p>
	The disadvantages: It is difficult to establish comparable control and experimental group

Secondly, the scope for experimentation with human beings is extremely limited.

Thirdly, experiment is often difficult to design, tends to be expensive and time- consuming

Fourthly, it is artificial to some extent and may lack realism.

Fifthly, experimentation can be used only in studies of the present but not in studies  related
to past or future.
</p>

<p>
	Sixthly, it is of no use in determining opinions, motives and intentions of persons.

  Finally, the results observed may not be the true effects of the experimental treatment, but
be artificial, i. e., effects of some extraneous variable. For instance, an experimenter may unwill
influence his subjects to behave 1n ways that confirm the hypothesis, particularly if the subjects
, to please the experimenter. Laboratory experiment is especially vulnerable to such
artificialities subjects know they are being studied and want to create a good impression
</p>

<h1>
	Laboratory Experiment
</h1>

<p>
	An experiment can be conducted either in a laboratory or in a real- life setting.

A laboratory experiment is an investigation conducted in a setting created specifically
purpose. The researcher manipulates an independent variable and studies its effect on a depend
variable, keeping other variables constant.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000187">187</pagenum>

 <h1>
	     page no:187
</h1>

<p>
    Purpose: The purpose of laboratory experiments are: (1) to discover cauSal relations under
uncontaminated conditions, reduce the discovered relations to functional form y = f(X) and make
predictions on the basis of the functions; (2) to test the predictions derived from theory and
other researches; and (3) to refine theories.
</p>

  <p>
	 Applications or uses: This method is useful not only in physical sciences research, but also in
social sciences research. Even though experimentation on a social science problem has special difficulties,
it can be used for a variety of studies such as voting behaviour, leadership style, learning process,
effectiveness of advertising media, effect of package on sales, influence of incentive schemes on
labour productivity and so on.
</p>

<p>

 Evaluation of this method: It has several merits They are:

1. The chief merit of experiment method is the possibility of securing relatively complete
   control over extraneous factors.

2. The experimenter can manipulate one or more variables and study its or their impact on a
   dependent variable.

3. The experimenter in most cases can achieve a high degree of specificity on operationalising
    the variables.

4. An experiment yields precise results and it is replicable.
</p>

<p>
	Demerits: The experimental method is not free from drawbacks.

1. The greatest weakness of this method is probably the lack of strength of independent.
  variables. As the laboratory situation is artificial, the effects of experimental manipulations
  are usually weak.

2. This method is highly structured, thus limiting flexibility.

3. The result cannot be simply generalized to real life situations, because in the latter, various
  extraneous forces operate. Thus, an experimental method lacks external validity (see para
  on Validity below).

    Nevertheless, the contributions of experimental method to theory building are so great that
this method is one of man’s greatest achievements.
</p>

<h1>
	Field Experiment
</h1>
<p>

  This is an experiment conducted in a real life situation in which the experimenter manipulates
an independent variable in order to test a hypothesis. Compared with laboratory experiment, a field
experiment incorporates less control. As it is difficult to foresee and control extraneous factors in a
field so experiment, its result is subject to large uncontrolled variation.
</p>

   <p>
	 Application or Uses: This method is well suited to both testing of theory and finding solutions
to practical social problems. It has been used for studying a variety of social action programmes such
as, improving the quality of work life in assembly- lines, post offices and insurance companies and
banks; learning process in educational institutions and training centres; changing group productivity;
changing organization culture; changing superior- subordinate relationship 1n organization, overcoming
resistance to change through participative approach; changing attitude through social contract; changing
food habits ;improving the effectiveness of mass education; testing new products 1n markets, determining
best procedures or techniques for tasks; and so on.

      <p>
	“Anyone who wishes to take effective social action in any setting can improve upon
uncontrolled, try out of new methods by the application of more scientific experimental procedure
Through careful measurements, better theorizing, the use of control groups, and other aspects
improved experimental design, the practical problems of social action can be solved with great
certainty, with greater accuracy, and sometimes with greater efficiency than through common-
trial- and- e—rror methods.”4
</p>

    <p>
	The field experiment will be more successful if preceded by a field study which gives a
thorough knowledge of the setting and thus enables the experimenter to manipulate and Control
variables more effectively.
</p>

<p>
	IlluStration: In a field experiment in a factory, Coch and French5 manipulated participation
workers in planning and studied its effect on various dependent variables — production, resignation
and aggression. The broad hypothesis tested was that resistance to Change can be overcome
increased participation in decisions or processes that lead to Change. Factory workers were divsion
into three groups. ‘1‘ he members of the control group did not participate in any of the discussions
decisions about Changes in the factory. Two experimental groups did participate in discussions
decision in different degrees: total participation and participation by representation. The results suppose the hypothesis.
</p>

<p>
	Evaluation Of the field experimental methods: This method has some unique virtues.

1. The variables in a field experiment usually have a stronger effect than those of a laborate
   experiment, as the field situation is real. Realism increases with strength of the variable

2. The field experiment permits a more unequivocal determination of causal relations, who
a mere non— experimental field study reveals only a correlation.

3. This method is particularly appropriate for studying methods of social influence,
processes and social changes in real life settings.

4. As the field experiment deals with the total life situation, it is well suited for study
complex syndromes and social processes where the interrelationships among many analytic
variables are involved.
</p>

<p>
	Limitations: The experimental method is not free from limitations.

1. The major limitations of this method is the practical difficulty involved in the manipulate
   of independent variables and randomization in many field situations.

2. Another weakness inherent in this method is lack of precision. Precise measurement
realistic situation is not so possible as in a laboratory setting.

3. A field experiment is a very difficult process, as it calls for social skills and good
on the part of the experimenter and also it is a time- consuming process. Unless the organization
where it has to be conducted and the subjects cooperate, it is not possible to conduct

<h1>
	  Validity, page no:189
</h1>

<p>
	An experiment should achieve two types of validity: internal and external validity. When the
effects of extraneous variables are eliminated and the observed effects on dependent variable can be
ascribed solely to the effect to experimented dependent variables, then the experiment has internal
validity. This IS generally achieved in a laboratory experiment, because 1n it extraneous variables are controlled.
</p>

<p>
	The extent to which the results of an experiment can be generalized to other settings is known
as external validity. The contribution of an experiment to the body of knowledge depends upon its
external validity.
</p>

<p>
	It is very difficult to achieve cent percent validity in an experiment, because there are
various threats to validity. Combell and Stanley6 list twelve threats to validity.
</p>

<p>
	1. Maturation: This means the effects of time. Between the pre-test and the post-test, the
subjects undergo various changes such as fatigue, boredom, growth or intellectual maturation which
may influence their performance and so the difference between the pre-test and post-test measurements
of their performance cannot be ascribed to the effect of experimental variables only. This source of
invalidity is eliminated/minimized by before—after design with control group, for the control group
also experiences the effects of time.
</p>

<p>
	2. History: Other extraneous events may occur during experimentation and thus influence the
result. These may be eVents that occur in the political, economic or cultural life of the people under
study or other minor events such as illness of a subject, disruption in the experiment of an interruption
from any  unwanted source. The influence of this source of invalidity is greater in a field
experiment than in laboratory experiment.
</p>

<p>
 3. Testing. It is impossible that the experience gained 1n the pre-test may result in an increase
post—test performance.
</p>

<p>
	This testing effect is confounded with the effect of experimental variable. The before- after
design with— control group guards against this source of invalidity also.
</p>

<p>
	4. Instrumentation: If the tests of instruments used for measurement are not accurate or consistent,
or if Observers become more experienced or careless, the results will be vitiated.
</p>

<p>
	5.Statistical regression: Those who scored highest on a pre-test are likely to score relatively
lower on a re-test, whereas subjects who score lowest in the pre-test are likely. to score higher on a
re-test. Thus their average score in re- -test may be closer to the overall population average. This is
merely a statistical illusion. Failure to recognize this effect may lead the researcher to arrive
at erroneous conclusion on the results.
</p>

<p>
	6.Differential selection: Selection bias arises when the experimental and control groups are not
as identical as possible. Techniques like random selection of subjects and matching may minimize the selection bias.
</p>

<p>
	7.Experimental mortality: This refers to loss of subject due to dropout, migration etc. This
likely 1n a long—term experiment, and affects the comparability of pre-test and post-test results.
The remedy is to omit the pre-test scores of subjects who did not take the post-test.

</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000190">190</pagenum>

 <h1>
	     page no: 190
</h1>

  <p>
	 8. Selection- maturation, selection- history or selection- -testing interaction: These interaction
between selection and other factors arise when the effect of the other factors differs between the
groups selected.
</p>

<p>
	9. Reactive effect of testing: The pre-test may affect the responsiveness of the experiment
group of the treatment. For example, pre-test measuring of knowledge about Denmark may sensitia
the sUbjects; as a result, they may be more receptive to the information given out in a film about
Denmark, which is the treatment under study.
</p>

 <p>
	10. Reactive effect of experimental arrangements: The knowledge of participation in a
experiment may introduce bias in favour of the experimental group. This reactive effect is population
known as the “Hawthrone effect”, since its importance was clearly demonstrated in the famous studies
conducted by Prof. Elton Mayo and his associates at the Hawthrone plant of Western Electric Compare
in Chicago during early 1930s In this enquiry into the relationship between physical work condition
and productivity, the output of a group of workers under various conditions was measured. They were
treated differently and they knew they were the subjects of the experiments. When light intensity was
increased, the workers output increased; but when the intensity of light was reduced, there was
reduction in their output, because of the reactive effect of experimental arrangements.
</p>

<p>
	11. Multi- treatment interference: In some experiment like medical experiments several types
of treatments are arrived at successively on the same subject. At each stage, the residual effect
of the previous treatment would interact with the effect of the next one.
</p>

<p>
	12. Contamination: This is a type of bias which arises when the researcher has some preview
knowledge about the subjects involved in an experiment. This may affect the objectivity of the
judgement.
</p>

<p>
   The researcher should be aware of the above threats and take appropriate measures like matching
randomization, etc., to minimize their effect and arrive at conclusions, keeping 1n view the limitations.

<h1>
	     7.7 SIMULATION
</h1>

<h1>
	Meaning
</h1>

<p>
	Simulation is one of the forms of observational methods. It is a process of conducting experiment
on a symbolic model representing a phenomenon. Abelson defines simulation as “the exercise of
flexible limitation of process and outcomes for the purpose of clarifying or explaining the underlying
mechanisms involved.”7 It is a symbolic abstraction, simplification and substitution for some refer
system.8 In other words, simulation is a theoretical model of the elements, relations and process
which symbolize some referent system, e.g., the flow of money in the economic system may
simulated in an operating model consisting of a set of pipes through which liquid moves. Simulation
is thus a technique of performing sampling experiments on the model of the systems. The experiment
are done on the model instead of on the real system, because the latter would be too inconvenience
and expensive.
</p>
<pagenum page="normal" id="page000191">191</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 The process of Simulation, page no:191
</h1>

<p>

  First the process or system to be simulated is identified.

  Second, the purpose of this simulation is decided. It may be to ‘clarify’ or ‘explain’ the process.

  Third, on the basis of the available information on the process or system- its components and
the set of conditions assumed to operate in and between the components- a mathematical model is

  Fourth, several sets of input data to be used are collected. Inputs may be samples of actual data
or synthetic data based on the general characteristics of real input data.

  Fifth, the type of simulation- computer simulation or man simulation or man-computer simulation
-to be used is determined.

  Lastly, the simulation is operated with the various sets of input data, and the results are analyzed to determine  the best solution.
</p>

<h1>
Simulation Vs. Experimentation
</h1>

  <p>
	 A real -life experiment may be too costly or may not be possible because of practical difficulties
or of the complexities of the phenomenon. For example, the search for an optimal approach to the
problem of inventory issue and replenishment through experimentation would disrupt operations for
a certain period of time and also would be very costly; phenomena, like macro- -sociological situations
or business systems are so complex, that it would not be possible to manipulate independent variables,
and to control extraneous variable in real- life experiments on them. Such difficulties do not arise in
simulation, because it experiments with models and can artificially manipulate variables

  Further, an experiment can extrapolate to, at best a few variables, whereas simulation, particularly
computer Simulation may often handle many variables including interpersonal and interpersonal
process.

  Simulation, unlike experiments, is best suited to the study of a system with a set of
 interrelated and interdependent sub-components.
</p>

<h1>
	Types of Simulation
</h1>

<p>
	There are three types of simulation, viz. (a) man simulations, (b) computer simulations and
(c) man- computer simulations.
</p>

<p>
	Man Simulation: This is a game played by people in a laboratory setting to simulate people
in real world. For example, number of individuals are divided into groups that are placed in a
laboratory room. Each group is instructed to imagine that it represents the government of a particular
nation. Simulated international situations involving treaties, alliances, threats, wars and the like are then played out by the groups.
</p>

<p>
	 No gaming model can serve as a universal model for all games. Each model is unique. The size
of the group is important factor. The size may be two persons, three persons or more than three
persons. other important dimensions are information level (whether individuals have perfect information
or not), and perceived goal motivation— no common interest and purely competitive or partly competitive and partly cooperative.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000192">192</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 page no: 192
</h1>

  <p>
	 Computer simulation: This is an operational model programmed to generate a sequence of
interactions. This requires precise definitions, storing of large amounts of data on the system to be
analyzed and programming of the analysis. For example, two or more sets of ratios relating to
liquidity, profitability and operational efficiency may be fed into a discriminant function analysis is
order to find out which set of variables has a better power to predict the financial health of an
enterprise.
</p>
<p>

     Man- computer simulation; In this type of simulation, persons play the role of decision- makers
while the computer is responsive to the players’ activities. In this game, the computer must be
provided with a script. “The script lists the messages conveyed to the player. Two kinds of messages
are involved. One is simple response to the players’ actions. The other is instruction to the
player as to the appropriate way he can respond to the computer.
</p>

<p>
	The successive runs of a simulation should give similar results. Then it is said to be reliable
This is rarely a problem in computer simulation, but it may be a problem in games. The reliability
in games requires that the physical equipment should not be cumbersome, the rules should be clear,
simple and complete and the game should not overtax the player’s span of attention.10
</p>

<p>
	Validity refers to the generalizability of the findings of the simulation. This depends on the
degree of correspondence between the operating model and its reference system.
</p>

<h1>
	Applications
</h1>

<p>
	Simulation is applicable to various categories of problems;

Behavioural and social problems, e. g, population dynamics, group behaviour; social conflicts;

(1) Political problems, e. g., predication of voting in elections; cold war conflicts, international
political situations, international counteractions to specific actions like diplomatic protests.
sanctions etc., study of revolutions;

(2) Economic problems e. g., study of economics under conditions of recession and inflation
developmental planning strategies, balance of payment policies, economic forecasting; urban
traffic system design; water resources development; flood control system; national manpower
planning.

(3) Business problems, e.g., determination of proper order quantities; production scheduling
designing complex distribution system; waiting line problems in transport services
maintenance scheduling in factories, airlines, bus service; assembly line scheduling in
consumer behaviour prediction; financial forecasting; introduction of a new product, control
system;
(4) War strategies and tactics.

	            7.8- INTERVIEWING
</h1>

<h1>
	Definition
</h1>

<p>
	Interviewing is one of the prominent methods of data collection. It may be defined as a two
way systematic conversation between an investigator and an informant, initiated for obtaining
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000193">193</pagenum>

  <h1>
	 page no:193
</h1>

Information  relevant to a specific study. It involves not only conversation, but also leaning from the
respondent s gestures, facial expressions and pauses, and his environment.

   Interviewing requires face- to face contact or contact over telephone and calls for interviewing
It is done by using a structured schedule or an unstructured guide.

<h1>
	Importance
</h1>

   <p>
	Interviewing may be used either as a main method or as a supplementary one in studies of
persons. Interviewing is the only suitable method for gathering information from illiterate or less
educated respondents. It is useful for collecting a wide range of data from factual demographic data
to highly personal and intimate information relating to a person’s opinions, attitudes, values, beliefs,
past Experience and future intentions. When qualitative information is required or probing is necessary
to draw out fully, then interviewing is required. Where the area covered for the survey is a compact,
or when a sufficient number of qualified interviewers are available, personal interview is feasible
</p>

  <p>
	Interview is often superior to other data- gathering methods. People are usually more willing to
talk than to write. Once rapport is established, even confidential information may be obtained. It
permits probing into the context and reasons for answers to questions.

    Interview can add flesh to statistical information. It enables the investigator to grasp the
behavioural context of the data furnished by the respondents. It permits the investigator to Seek
classifications and brings to the forefront those question, that for one reason or another, respondents do not want to answer.
</p>

<h1>
	Evaluation of Interviewing
</h1>

  <p>
	Advantages: There are several real advantages to personal interviewing. First, “the greatest
 value of this method is the depth and detail of information that can be secured.12 When used with
a well- conceived schedule, an interview can obtain a great deal of information. It far exceeds mail
Survey in amount and quality of data that can be secured.
</p>

  <p>
	Second, the interviewer can do more to improve the percentage of responses and the quality of
information received than other method. He can note the conditions of the interview situation, and
adopt appropriate approaches to overcome such problems as ”the respondent’s unwillingness, incorrect understanding of question, suspicion, etc.
</p>

  <p>
	Third, the interviewer can gather other supplemental information like economic level, living
conditions etc. Through observation of the respondent’s environment.
</p>

  <p>
	 Fourth, the interviewer can use special scoring devices, visual materials and like in order to
improve the quality of interviewing.
</p>

  <p>
	 Fifth, the accuracy and dependability of the answers given by the respondent can be checked
by observation and probing.
</p>

 <p>
	Last, interview is flexible and adaptable to individual situations. Even more control can be
exercised over the interview situation.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000194">194</pagenum>

  <h1>
	page no: 194
</h1>

<p>
	Limitations: Interviewing is not free from limitations. Its greatest drawback is that it is cost
both in money and time.

  Second, the interview results are often adversely affected by interviewer’s mode of asking
questions and interactions, and incorrect recording and also be the respondent’s faulty perception
faulty memory, inability to articulate etc.

   Third, certain types of personal and financial information may be refused in face-to—face interview
Such information might be supplied more willingly on mail questionnaires, especially if they are
be unsigned.

   Fourth, interview poses the problem of recording information obtained from the respondents.
foolproof system is available. Note taking is invariably distracting to both the respondent and
interviewer and affects the thread of the conversation.

Last, interview calls for highly skilled interviewers. The availability of such persons is limit
and the training of interviewers is often a long and costly process.
</p>

<h1>
	Characteristics
</h1>

<p>
	Interviewing as a method of data collection has certain characteristics. They are:

1. The participants — the interviewer and the respondent - are strangers. Hence, the investigators
   has to get himself introduced to the respondent in an appropriate manner.

2. The relationship between the participants is a transitory one. It has a fixed beginning
   termination points. The interview proper is a fleeting, momentary experience for them.

3. Interview is not a mere casual conversational exchange, but a conversation with a special
   purpose, viz., obtaining information relevant to a study.

4. Interview is a mode of obtaining verbal answers to questions put verbally.

5. The interaction between the interviewer and the respondent need not necessarily be one
   face- to— face basis, because interview can be conducted over the telephone also.

6. Although interview is usually a conversation betWeen two persons, it need not be limit
to a single respondent. It can also be conducted with a group of persons, such as frame
members, or a group of children or a group of customers, depending on the requirement
of the study.

7. Interview is an interactional process. The interaction between the interviewer and
respondent depends upon how they perceive each other. The respondent reacts to
interviewer’s appearance, behaviour, gestures, facial expression and intonation, his percept
of the thrust of the questions and his own personal needs. As far as possible, the interviewing
should try to be closer to the socio- economic level of the respondents. Moreover, he should
realize that his respondents are under no obligation to extend response. He should, therefore
be tactful and be alert to such reactions of the respondents as lame- excuse, suspicious
reluctance or indifference, and deal with them suitably. He should not also argue or dis
He should rather maintain an impartial and objective attitude. .1

8.Information furnished by the respondent in the interview is recorded by the investigation
 This poses a problem of seeing that recording does not interfere with the tempo
conversation.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000195">195</pagenum>

<h1>
	 page no:195
</h1>
<p> 9. Interviewing is not a standardized process like that of a chemical technician, it is rather a
    flexible psychological process.

   The implication of this feature is that the interviewer cannot apply unvarying standardized
technique, because he is dealing with respondents with varying motives and diverse perceptions. The
extent of his success as an interviewer is very largely dependent upon his insight and skill in
dealing with varying socio-psychological situations.
</p>

<h1>
	Requirements
</h1>

<p>
	The requirements or conditions necessary for a successful interview are:

1. Data availability: The needed information should be available with the respondent. He
should be able to conceptualize it in terms useful to the study, and be capable of
communicating it.

2. Role perception: The respondent should understand his role and know what is required of
  him. He should know what is a relevant answer and how complete it should be. He can learn
  much of this from the interviewer’s introduction, explanations and questioning procedure.

3. The interviewer should also know his role. He should establish a permissive atmosphere and
  encourage frank and free conversation. He should not affect the interview situation through
 subjective attitude, argumentation, etc.

4. Respondent’s motivation: The respondent should be willing to respond and give accurate
   answer. This depends partly on the interviewer’s approach and skill. The interview has
  interest in it for the purpose of his research, but the respondent has no personal interest in
  it. Therefore, the interviewer should establish a friendly relationship with the respondent,
  and create in him an interest in the subject- matter of the study.

The interviewer should try to reduce the effect of demotivating factors like desire to get on
 with other activities, embarrassment at ignorance, dislike of the interview content, suspicious
about the interviewer, and fear of consequences. He should also try to build up the effect
of motivating factors like curiosity, loneliness, politeness, sense of duty, respect of the
research agency and liking for the interviewer.
</p>

<p>
	The above requirement reminds that the interview is an interactional process. The investigator
should keep this in mind and take care to see that his appearance and behaviour do not distort the
interview situation.
</p>

<h1>
	Types of Interviews
</h1>

<p>
	interviews may be classified into: (a) structured or directive interview, (b) unstructured or
non- directive interview, (c) focused interview, and ((1) clinical interview and (d) depth interview.
</p>


<h1>
	Structured, Directive Interview
</h1>

<p>
	This is an interview made with a detailed standardized schedule. The same questions are put to
all the respondents and in the same order. Each questiOn is asked 1n the same way in each interview
, promoting measurement reliability. This type of interview is used for large-scale formalized
surveys.
</p>

<p>
	Advantages. This interview has certain advantages. First, data from one interview to the next
one are easily comparable. Second, recording and coding data do not pose any problem, and greater
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000196">196</pagenum>

<h1>
	    page no:196
</h1>

<p>
  The focused interview permits the interviewer to obtain details of personal reactions, specific
emotions and the like.
</p>

 <p>
	 Merits: This type of interview is free from the inflexibility of formal methods, yet gives the
interview a set form and insures adequate coverage of all the relevant topics.

  The respondent is asked for certain information, yet he has plenty of opportunity to present his
views.

  The interviewer is also free to choose the sequence of questions and determine the extent of
probing.
</p>

<h1>
	Clinical Interview
</h1>
  <p>
	 This is similar to the focused interview but with a subtle difference. While the focused interview
is concerned with the effects of a specific experience, clinical interview is concerned with broad
underlying feelings or motivations or with the course of the individual’ s life experiences.
</p>

    <p>
	The ‘Personal history’ interview used in social case work, prison administration, psychiatric
clinics and in individual life history research is the most common type of clinical interview. The
specific aspects of the individual’s life history to be covered by the interview are determined with
reference to the purpose of the study and the respondent is encouraged to talk freely about them.
</p>

<h1>
	Depth Interview
</h1>


  <p>
	This  is an intensive and searching interview aiming at studying the respondent’s opinion, emotions
or convictions  on the basis of an interview guide. This requires much more training inter-personal
skills than structured interviewing. This deliberately aims to elicit unconscious as well as extremely personal feelings and emotions.

   This is generally a lengthy procedure designed to encourage free expression of affectively
charged information. It requires probing.

   The interviewer should totally avoid advising or showing disagreement. Of course, he should
use encouraging expressions like “uh— huh” or “I see” to motivate the respondent to continue narration.
sometimes the depth interviewer has to face the problem of affection, i.e., the respondent may hide
expressing affective feelings. The interviewer should handle such situation with great care.
</p>

<h1>
	Interviewing Process
</h1>

<p>
	The interviews process consists of the following stages:

   Preparation

   Introduction

   Developing rapport

  Carrying the interview forward

  Recording the interview, and

 Closing the interview.
</p>


  <p>
	 Preparation: The interviewing requires some preplanning and preparation. The interviewer
Should keep the copies of interview schedule/ guide (as the case may be) ready for use. He should also
have the list of names and addresses of respondents, he should regroup them into contiguous groups
in terms of location in order to save time and cost in travelling.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000197">197</pagenum>

<h1>
	     page no:197
</h1>

    <p>
	The interviewer should find out the general daily routine of the respondents in order to
determine  the suitable timings for interview.
</p>

    <p>
	Above all, he should mentally prepare himself for the interview. He should think about how he
should approach a respondent, what mode of introduction he could adopt, what situations he my have
to face and how he could deal with them.
</p>

   <p>
	 The interviewer may come across such situations as respondents’ avoidance, reluctance, suspicion
diffidence, inadequate responses, distortion, etc. The investigator should plan the strategies for dealing
with them. If such preplanning is not done, he will be caught unaware and fail to deal appropriate
when he actually faces any such situation. It is possible to plan in advance and keep the plan and mind flexible and expectant of new development.
</p>

    <p>
	 Introduction: The investigator is a stranger to the respondents. Therefore he should be properly
introduced to each of the respondents. What is the proper mode of introduction? There is no are
appropriate universal mode of introduction. Mode varies according to the type of respondents.
</p>

  <p>
	When making a study of an organization or institution, the head of the organization should be
approached first and his cooperation secured before contacting the sample inmates/ employees.

  When studying a community or a cultural group, it is essential to approach the leader first
to enlist his cooperation.
</p>
<p>

   For a survey or urban households, the research organization’s letter of introduction and the
interviewer’s identify card can be shown. In these days of fear of opening the door for a stranger
residents’ cooperation can be easily secured, if the interviewer attempts to get him introduced
through a person known to them, say a popular person in the area e. g., a social worker.
</p>


<p>
		For interviewing rural respondents, the interviewer should never attempt to approach them along
with someone from the revenue department, for they would immediately hide themselves, presuming
that they are being contacted for collection of land revenue or subscription to some government board.
He should not also approach them through a local political leader, because persons who do not belong
to his party will not cooperate with the interviewer. It is rather desirable to approach the rural
respondents through the local teacher or social worker.
</p>

  <p>
	 After getting himself introduced to the respondent in the most appropriate manner, the interview
can follow a sequence of procedures as under, in order to motivate the respondent to permit the
interview:

  With a smile greet the respondent in accordance with his cultural pattern

  Identify the respondent by name

  Describe the method, by which the respondent Was selected

  Mention the name of the organization conducting the research

  Assure the anonymity or confidential nature of the interview

  Explain their usefulness of the study

  Emphasize, the value of respondent’s cooperation, making suCh statements as. "you are
among the few in a position to supply the information. your response is invaluable"
I have come to learn from your experience and knOwledge.”

talk of Japanese Style of management, American style of management and so on. What is the style
of management in Indian enterprises? Is it just an imitation of Western style or is it based on our
culture and value system? We should know the nature of our style of management. Is it not? This
study is done throughout the country and the results will contribute to management thought and
profession.”
</p>

 <p>
	"The respondents for interview chosen may entirely change. The interview will just take about
half- an- hour. All information is entirely confidential, of course.”
</p>

 <p>
	A respondent often has reservations about being interviewed. He may suspect that the interviewer
is a disguised salesman, bill collector, tax official or the like. The interviewer should
skillfully clear such suspicion by establishing his identity.
</p>

<p>
    The respondent may also feel incompetent or fear that he may not be able to answer questions
relating to the study. Allay such kind of anxiety by reassuring him: “There are no right or wrong
answers. This is not a quiz. We are trying to find how persons like you feel.”
</p>

<p>
	Developing rapport: Before starting the research interview, the interviewer should establish a
friendly relationship with the respondent. This is described as “rapport.” It means establishing a
relationship of confidence and understanding between the interviewer and the respondent. It 1s a skill
which depends primarily on the interviewer’s commonsense, experience, sensitivity, and keen
observation.
</p>

<p>
	Start the conversation with a general topic of interest such as weather, current news, sports
event, or the like perceiving the probable interest of the respondent from his context.
</p>

 <p>
	 Such initial conversation may create a friendly atmosphere and a warm interpersonal relationship
and mutual understanding of the other. However the interviewer should “guard against the over-
rapport" as cautioned by Herbert Hyman.14 Too much identification and too much courtesy result in
tailoring replies to the image of a ‘nice interviewer.” The interviewer should use his discretion
in striking a happy medium.
</p>

<p>
	Carrying the interview forward:  After establishing rapport, the technical task of asking questions
from the interview schedule starts. This task requires care, self- restraint, alertness and
ability to listen with understanding, respect and curiosity.
</p>

<p>
	In carrying on this task of gathering information from the respondent by putting questions to
the following guidelines may be followed:

1. Start the interview. Carry it on in an informal, natural conversational style.

2. Ask all the applicable questions in the same order as they appear on the schedule without
any elucidation and change in the wording. Ask all the applicable questions listed in the
schedule. Do not take answers for granted.

3. If interview guide is used, the interviewer may tailor his questions to each respondent,
   covering, of course, the areas to be investigated.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000199">199</pagenum>

 <h1>
	    page no:199
</h1>

<p>

4. Know the objectives of each questions so as to make sure that the answers adequately
  satisfy the question objectives.

5. If a question is not understood, repeat it slowly with proper emphasis and appropriate
   explanation when necessary.

6. Take all answers naturally, never showing disapproval or surprise. When the respondent
does not meet with interruptions, denial, contradiction and other harassment, he may feel
free and may not try to withhold information. He will be motivated to communicate when
the atmosphere is permissive and the listener’s attitude is non-judgement and is genuinely
absorbed in the revelations.

7. Listen quietly with patience and humility. Give not only undivided~ attention, but also
personal warmth. At the same time, be alert and analytic to incomplete, nonspecific
inconsistent answers, but avoid interrupting the ﬂow of information. If necessary, jot down
unobtrusively the points which need elaboration or verification for later and more timely
probing.

 The appropriate technique for this probing is to ask for further clarification in such a polite
manner as: “I am not sure I understood fully. Is this.... what you meant?”

8. Neither argue nor dispute.

9. Show genuine concern and interest in the ideas expressed by the respondent, at the same
time, maintain an impartial and objective attitude.

10. Should not reveal your own opinion or reaction. Even when you are asked for your views,
laugh off the request, saying “Well, your opinions are more important than mine.”

11. At times the interview “runs dry” and needs restimulation. Then use such expression as
“Uh-huh” or “That’s interesting” or “I see,” “can you tell me more about that?” and the like

12. When the interviewee fails to supply his reactions to related past experiences, represent the
stimulus situation, intrOducing appropriate questions which will aid in revealing the past
“Under what circumstances did such and such a phenomenon occur?” or “How did you feel
about it and the like.

13. At times, the conversation may go off the track. Be alert to discover drifting, steer the
conversation back to the track by some such remark as, “You know, I was very much
interested in what you said a moment ago. Could you tell me more about it?"

14.When the conversation turns to some intimate subjects, and particularly when it deals with
crises in the life of the individual, emotional blockage may occur. Then drop the subject for
the time being and pursue another line of conversation for a while so that a less direct
approach to the subject can be made later.

15. When there 1s a pause in the flow of information, do not hurry the interview. Take is as a
matter of course with an interested look or a sympathetic half- smile. If the silence is too
prolonged, introduce a stimulus saying “You mentioned that.... What happened then?”

</p>

</h1>

 <p>
	Additional sittings: In the case of qualitative interviews involving longer duration, one single
sitting will not do, as it would cause interview weariness. Hence, it is desirable to have two or
more sittings with the consent of the respondent.
</p>

<p>
	Recording the interview: It is essential to record responses as they take place. If the note-
taking is done after the interview, a good deal of relevant information may be lost. Nothing should
be made in the schedule under respective question. It should be complete and verbatim. The responses
 should not be summarized or paraphrased. How can complete recording be made without interrupting
the free ﬂow of conversation? Electronic transcription through devices like tape recorder can achieve
this. It has obvious advantages over note- -taking during the interview. But it also has certain
disadvantages Some respondents may object to or fear‘ ‘going on record.” Consequently the risk of
lower response rate will arise especially for sensitive topics.
</p>

<p>
	If the interviewer knows short- hand, he can use it with advantage. Otherwise, he can write
    rapidly by abbreviating word and using only key words and the like. However, even the fast
   writer may fail to record all that is said at conversational speed. At such times, it is useful to
  interrupt by some such comment as “that seems to be a very important point, would you mind
  repeating it, so that I can get your words exactly.” The respondent is usually flattered by this
  attention and the rapport is not disturbed.
</p>

<p>
	The interviewer should also record all his probes and other comments on the schedule in
brackets to set them off from responses.
</p>

<p>
	With the pre-coded structured questions, the interviewers task is easy. He has to simply ring the
appropriate code or tick the appropriate box, as the case may be. He should not make mistakes by
carelessly ringing or ticking a wrong item.
</p>

<p>
	Closing the interview: After the interview is over, take leave Off the respondent, thanking
him with a friendly smile.

    In the case of a qualitative interview of longer duration, select the occasion for departure more
carefully. Assembling the papers for putting them in the folder at the time of asking the final question
sets the  stage for a final handshake, a thank- you and a good-bye. If the respondent desires to know
the result of the survey, note down his name and address so that a summary of the result could be
posted to him when ready.
</p>

<p>
	Editing: At the close of the interview, the interviewer must edit the schedule to check that he
has asked all the questions and recorded all the answers and that there is no inconsistency between
answers. Abbreviations 1n recording must be replaced by full words. He must ensure that everything
is legible.
</p>

<p>
	It is desirable to record a brief sketch of his impressions of the interview and observational notes
on the respondent's living environment, his attitude to the survey, difficulties, if any, faced in securing
his  cooperation and the interviewer’s assessment of the validity of the respondent’s answers.
</p>

<h1>
	Interview Problems
</h1>

<p>
	In an personal interviewing, the researcher must deal with two major problem, inadequate response,
non-response and interviewer’s bias.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000201">201</pagenum>

<h1>
	 page no:201
</h1>

   <p>
	Inadequate response: Kahn and Cannel15 distinguish five principal symptoms of inadequate
response. They are: partial response, in which the respondent gives a relevant but incomplete answer
non-response when the respondent remains silent or refuses to answer the question, irrelevant response,
in which the respondent’s answer is not relevant to the question asked; inaccurate response, when the
reply IS biased or distorted; and the verbalized response problem, which arises on account of
respondent's failure to understand a question or lack of information necessary for answering it.
</p>

   <p>
	 One possible approach to deal with an inadequate response is to allow a brief expectant pause
with an expectant glance. Another way to encourage the respondent IS to use such expressions as, "I
see?” “Is it?” or to put a supplementary neutral question as “What do you mean?”, “Can you tell me
more about that?” or “Can you explain little more fully?”
</p>

  <p>
	If the respondent’s answer is ambiguous or inexplicit, probes like “How do you mean?” or "In
what way?” can be used to clarify his answer. For exploring other aspects of the respondent’s opinion
if any, probes like “Is there anything else?” or “Are there any other reasons?” can be used.
</p>

 <p>
	 For a ‘don’ t know’ answer, over-probing is counter- -productive. If motivational probing fails
further probing should be attempted.
</p>

  <p>
	The problem of inaccurate response is common in economic surveys. The respondents have
difficulty in furnishing accurate information on ‘sensitive’ matters like asset holdings, income
expenditure, saving and investments. It is difficult to deal with this problem. Perhaps one possible
approach is to use indirect questions instead of direct questions for securing information on above
matters, and to cross- c-heck with information furnished on other related questions For example,
data on income can be verified with the details on occupation.
</p>

   <p>
	Interviewer’ s bias: The interviewer is an important cause of response bias. He may resort to
cheating by ‘cooking up’ data without actually interviewing.
</p>

   <p>
	The interviewers can influence the responses by inappropriate suggestions, word emphasis, tone
of voice and question rephrasing. His own attitudes and expectations about what a particular
category of respondents may say or think may bias the data.
</p>

   <p>
	The respondent’s perception of the interviewer’s characteristics (education, apparent social
   status, etc) may also bias his answers.
</p>

  <p>
	 Another source of response bias arises from interviewer’s perception of the situation. If he
regards the assignment as impossible or sees the results of the survey as a possible threat to
personal  interests or beliefs he is likely to introduce bias.
</p>

   <p>
	As interviewers are human beings, such biasing factors can never be overcome completely, but
their effects can be reduced by careful selection and training of interViewers, proper motivation and
supervision, standardization of interview procedures (use of standard wording in survey questions,
standard instructions on, probing procedure an so on) and standardization of interviewer behaviour
There is need for more research on ways to minimize bias in the interview.
</p>

<h1>
	Non-response
</h1>

<p>
	Non—response refers to failure to obtain reSponses from some sample respondents. There are
many sources of non- response, non-availability, refusal, incapacity, inacCessibility.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000202">202</pagenum>

 <h1>
	     page no:202
</h1>

  <p>
	 Non-availability: Some respondents may not be available at home at the time of call. This
depends upon the nature of the respondent and the time of calls. For example employed persons may
not be available during working hours. Farmers may not be available at home during cultivation
season. Selection of appropriate timing for calls could solve this problem. Evenings and weekends
may be favourable interviewing hours for such respondents. If someone is available, then the
respondent's hours of availability can be ascertained and the next visit can be planned
accordingly.

  A respondent may be too busy, tired or out of station.

  Call- backs to find the not- at- homes increase the overall response rate.
</p>

 <p>
	Refusal: Some persons may refuse to furnish information because they are ill- disposed, or
approached at the wrong hour and so on. Although a hardcore of refusals remain, another try or
perhaps another approach may find some of them cooperative.
</p>

 <p>
	Incapacity or inability may refer to illness which prevents a response during the entire
survey period. This may also arise on account of language barrier.
</p>

 <p>
	Inaccessibility: Some respondents may be inaccessible. Some may not be found due to migration
and other reasons.
</p>

<p>
	 Non- responses reduce the effective sample size and its representativeness.
</p>

<p>

   Methods and aims of control of non-response: Kish16 suggests the following methods to
reduce either the percentage of non— response or its effects:

(1) Improved procedures for collecting data are the most obvious remedy for non—response.
Improvements advocated are (a) guarantees of anonymity, (b) motivation of the respondent
to cooperate, (c) arousing the respondents’ interest with clever opening remarks and questions,
(d) advance notice to the respondents.

(2) Call-backs are most effective way of reducing not-at-homes in personal interviews, as are
repeated mailings to no- returns in mail surveys.

(3) Substitution for the non- response is often suggested as a remedy. Usually this is a mistake,
because the substitutes resemble the responses rather than the non-responses. Nevertheless
beneficial substitution methods can sometimes be designed with reference to important
characteristic of the population. For example, in a farm management study, the farm size
is an important variable and if the sampling is based on farm size, substitution for a
respondent with a particular size holding by another with the holding of the same size is
 possible.
</p>

 <p>
	 Attempts to reduce the percentage or effects on non-respbnses aim at reducing the bias caused
by differences on non- respondents from respondents. The non- response bias should not be confused
with the reduction of sample size due to non-response. The latter effect can be easily overcome, either
by anticipating the size of non-response in designing the sample size or by compensating for it with
a supplement These adjustments increase the size of the response and the sampling precision, but
they not reduce the non- response percentage or bias.
</p>

<h1>
	Telephone Interviewing
</h1>

  <p>
	Telephone interviewing is a non-personal method of data collection. It may be used as a major
method or supplementary method.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000203">203</pagenum>

<h1>
	    page no:203
</h1>

<p>
	Uses: It will be useful in the following situations:

1. When the universe is composed of those persons whose names are listed in telephone
directories, e .g., business houses, business executives, doctors, other professionals.

2. When the study requires responses to five or six simple questions, e.g., Radio or Television
programme survey.

3. When the survey must be conducted in a very short period of time, provided the units of
study are listed in telephone directory.

4. When the subject is interesting or important to respondents, e. g., A survey relating to trade
conducted by a trade association or a chamber of commerce, a survey relating to a profession
conducted by the concerned professional association.

5. When the respondents are widely scattered and when there are many call backs to make.
</p>

<p>

	Evaluation Advantages: The advantages of telephone interview are:

1. The survey can be completed at very low cost, because telephone survey does not involve
   travel time and cost and all calls can be made from a single location .

2. Information can be collected in a short period of time. 5 to 10 interviews can be conducted
per hour.

3. Quality of response is good, because interviewer bias is reduced as there is no face- to- face
contact between the interviewer and the respondent.

4. This method of interviewing is less demanding upon the interviewer.

5. It does not involve field work

6. Individuals who could not be reached or who might not care to be interviewed personally
can be contacted easily.
</p>

<p>
	Disadvantages: Telephone interview has several limitations.

1. It is limited to persons with listed telephones. The sample will be distorted, if the universe
includes persons not on phone. In several countries like India only a few persons have
phone facility and that too in urban areas only. Telephone facility is very rare in rural areas
Hence, the method is not useful for studying the general population.

2. There is a limit to the length of interview. Usually, a call cannot last over five minutes.
five or six simple questions can be asked. Hence, telephone cannot be used for a longer
questionnaire.

3. The type of information to be collected is limited to what can be given in simple, short
answers of a few words. Hence telephone 18 not suitable for complex surveys, and there is
no possibility of obtaining detailed information. -.

4. If the questions cover personal matters, most respondents will not cooperate with the
interviewer.

5.The respondent’s characteristics and environment cannot be observed.

6.It is not possible to use visual aids like charts, maps, illustrations or complex scales.

7.It is rather difficult to establish rapport between the respondent and the interviewer.

8.There is no possibility to ensure the identity of the interviewer and to overcome suspicions.

 <h1>
Group Interviews, page no:204
</h1>

<p>
	Meaning and nature: A group interview may be defined as a method of collecting primary data
in which a number of individuals with a common interest interact with each other. In a personal
interview, the ﬂow of information is multi-dimensional.
</p>

  <p>
	 The group may consist of about six to eight individuals with a common interest. The interviewer
acts the discussion leader. Free discussion is encouraged on some aspect of the subject under
study. The discussion leader stimulates the group members to interact with each other.
</p>

  <p>
	 The desired information may be obtained through self- administered questionnaires or interview,
with the discussion serving as a guide to ensure consideration of the areas of concern. In particular,
the interviewers look for evidence of common elements of attitudes, beliefs, intentions and opinions
among individuals in the group. At the same time, he must be aware that a single comment by a
member can provide important insight.
</p>

 <p>
	Samples for group interview can be obtained through schools, clubs and other organized groups.
</p>

<p>
	Uses: The group interview technique can be employed by researchers in studying people’s
reactions on public amenities, public health prOjects, welfare schemes, etc. It is a popular method in
marketing research to evaluate new product .or service concepts, brand names, packages, promotional
strategies and attitudes. When an organization needs a great variety of information inasmuch detail
possible at a relatively low cost and in a short period of time, the group interview technique is more
useful. It can be used to generate primary data in the exploratory phase of a project.
</p>

<p>
Evaluation: Advantages: The advantages of this technique are:

1. The respondents comment freely and in detail.

2. The method is highly flexible. The flexibility helps the research work with new concepts
   or topics which have not been previously investigated.

3. Visual aids can be used.

4. A group can be interviewed in the time required for one personal interview.

5. The client can watch the interview unobserved.

6. Respondents are. more articulate in a group than in the individual interview.

7. The technique eliminates the physical limitations inherent in individual interviews.
</p>

 <p>
	Disadvantages: This method is not free from draw backs.

1. It IS difficult to get a representative sample.

2. There is the possibility of the group being dominated by one individual.

3. The respondents may answer to please the interviewer or the other members in the group.

   Nevertheless, the advantages of this technique outweigh the. disadvantages and the technique is
found to be useful for surveys on topics of common interest.

	Section and Training of Interviewers
</h1>

   <p>
	The quality of data collected depends ultimately upon the capabilities of interviewers. Hence,
careful selection and proper training of interViewers is essential. (See for detailed discussion, 9. 2
"Section of Training 0f Investigators” in chapter 9, below).
</p>

<h1>
      7.9 PANEL METHOD, page no:205
</h1>

<h1>
	Meaning
</h1>

     <p>
	The panel method is a method of data collection, by which data is collected from the same
sample respondents at intervals either by mail of by personal interview. This is used for longitudinal
studies on economic conditions, expenditure pattern, consumer behaviour, recreational pattern
effectiveness of advertising, voting behaviour, and so on. The period over which the panel members
are contacted for information may spread over several months or years. The time interval at which
they are contacted repeatedly may be 10 or 15 days, or one or two months depending on the nature
of the study and the memory span of the respondents.
</p>

<h1>
	Characteristics
</h1>


	<p>
	The basic characteristic of the panel method is successive collection of data on the same items
from the same persons over a period of time.

   The type of information to be collected should be such facts that can be accurately and
completely furnished by the respondent without any reservation.

   The number of item should be as few as possible so that they could be furnished within a few
minutes, especially when mail survey is adopted. T average amount of time that a panel member
has to spend each time for reporting can be determined in a pilot study.

   The panel method requires carefully selected and well— trained field workers and effect
supervision over their work.
</p>

<h1>
	Need for Panel Study
</h1>

    <p>
	When sample respondents —— particularly households or individuals-are contacted once only
they may not be able to recall exactly what have occurred during a longer time period, say a year
because their memory Span is short. Therefore they will not be able to give correct information on
such facts as cash inflow, source-wise income, expenditure pattern, purchases, savings, recreation
pattern and so~ on. But when they are contacted successively at short intervals of 10 or 15 days,
would to able to give accurate information on happenings between two successive contacts, as the
time span is short and well within the memory span. In this way, data are collected repeatedly at
intervals, and computations for the required period like a year can be easily made and the data so
collected will be more reliable.
</p>

<h1>
	Illustration
</h1>

<p>
	The author of this book adopted the panel method for collection of data for a major research
project (funded by ICSSR) entitled “The Factors affecting the Economic Conditions of Agricultural
Labourers in Coimbatore District” (1971 -.72) 17 This study involved collection of primary data from
a sample farmers and sample labourers. The sample farmers were contacted 36 times in the year 1971
- 1972 once every ten days and data on their farm Operations, number of labourers employed, wages
paid etc. were collected. Similarlythe sample labourers were contacted repeatedly once every ten
days and data on the number of days employed, type Of work, wage earned and item-wise eXpenditure etc.,

were collected. On the completion of the entire field work, annual data were compiled from the ten - day long data.

<h1>
	Types of Panels
</h1>

 <p>
	The panel may be static or dynamic. A static or continuous panel 18 one in which the membership
remains the same throughout the life of the panel, except for the members who drop out. The
dropouts are not replaced.

    The static panel is appropriate when the purpose is to study changes 1n a given group of
persons over a period of time. The main drawbacks of the static panel are:

1. Due to dropouts, it ceases to be representative of the original universe after a time.

2. The size of the reporting panel may become too small for satisfactory results.

   In a dynamic panel, to keep the panel representative of the current population in the area
covered by the universe, replacement are found for the members who drop out. A dynamic panel may
also be a rotating one, in which members are systematically replaced at specified time intervals.

  The dynamic panel is most useful when it is important to keep the panel representative of the
population at all times. The main problem connected with its use is the cost and difficulty of
recruiting new members to replace the dropouts.
</p>

<h1>
	Evaluation
</h1>

<p>
	Advantages. The advantages of panel method are:

1. This method facilitates collection of more accurate data for longitudinal studies than any
   other method, because under this method event or action is reported soon after its occurrence.

2. This method makes it possible to have before-after designs for field-based studies. For
example, the effect of public relations or advertising campaigns or welfare measures can be
measured by collecting data before, during and after the campaign.

3. The panel method offers a good way of studying trends in events, behaviour or attitudes.
For example, a panel enables a market researcher to study how brand preferences change
from month to month; it enables an economics researcher to study how employment, income
and expenditure of agricultural labourers change from month; to month; a political scientist
can study the shifts in inclinations of voters and the causative influential factors during an
election; it is possible to find out how the constituency of the various economy and social
strata of society changes through time; and so on.

4. A panel study also provides evidence on the casual relationship betWeen variables. For
example, a cross— —sectional study of employees may show an association between their
attitude to their jobs and their positions in the organization, but it does not indicate which
came first — favourable attitude or promotion. A panel study can provide data for finding
an answer to this question.

5. If facilitates depth interviewing, because panel members becOme well acquainted with the
field Workers and will be willing to allow probing interviews.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000207">207</pagenum>

<h1>
	page no:207
</h1>

<p>
	Limitations: The major limitations or problems of the panel method are:

1. This method is very expensive. The selection of panel members, the payment of premiums,
periodic visits of investigators and supervisors, and the costs involved in replacing dropouts,
all add to the expenditures.

2. It is often difficult to set up a representative panel and to keep it representative. Many
persons may be unwilling to participate in a panel study. In the course of the study, there
may be frequent dropouts. The dropouts may be replaced by persons with similar
characteristics. But there is no guarantee that the emerging panel would be a representative
one.

3. A real danger with the panel method is “panel conditioning”, i.e., the risk that repeated
interviews may sensitize the panel members and they become untypical as a result of being
on the panel. For example, the members of a panel study of political opinions may try to
appear consistent in the views they express on consecutive occasions. In such cases, the
panel becomes untypical of the population it was selected to represent. One possible safeguard
to panel conditioning is to give members of a panel only a limited panel life and then to
replace them with persons taken randomly from a reserve list.

4. The quality of reporting may tend to decline due to decreasing interest after a panel has been
in operation for some time. Cheating by panel members or investigators may be a problem
in some cases.

	                  7.10 MAIL SURVEY
</h1>

<h1>
	Definition
</h1>

      The mail survey is another method of collecting primary data. This method involves sending
questionnaires to the respondents with a request to complete them and return them by post. This can
be used in the case of educated respondents only. The mail questionnaires should be simple so that

the respondents can easily understand the questions and answer them. It should preferably contain
mostly closed-end and multiple- choice questions so that it could be completed within a few minutes.

     The distinctive feature of the mail survey is that the questionnaire is self- administered bythe
respondents themselves and the responSes are recorded by them, and not by the investigator as in the
case of personal interview method. It does not involve face— to- face conversation between the investigator
and the respondent. Communication 18 carried out only in writing and this requires more cooperation from the respondents than does verbal communication.

<h1>
	Procedure
</h1>

    <p>
	 The researcher should prepare a mailing list of the selected respondents by collecting the
addresses from the telephone directory of the association or organization to which they belong.

    A covering letter should accompany a copy of the questionnaire. Exhibit 7.1 is a copy of a
covering letter used by the author in a research study on ‘Corporate Planning.’ It must explain  to the
respondent the purpose of the study and the importance of his cooperation to the success of the
project. Anonymity may be assured.

	A Covering Letter used for a Study on 'Corporate Planning’
</h1>

  <p>
	 The sponsor’s identity may be revealed. However when such information may bias the results,
it is not desirable to reveal it. In the later case, a disguised organization name may be used.

    A self- addressed stamped envelope should be enclosed in the covering letter.

    After a few days from the date of mailing the questionnaires to the respondents, the researcher-
can expect the return of completed ones from them. The progress in return may be watched and at
the appropriate stage follow- up efforts can be made.
</p>

<h1>
	Alternative Modes of Sending Questionnaires
</h1>

 <p>
	There are some alternative methods of distributing questionnaires to the respondents. They are
: (1) personal delivery, (2) attaching questionnaire to a product. (3) advertising
questionnaire in a news paper of magazine, and (4) news stand inserts.
</p>

 <p>
	Personal delivery: The researcher or his assistant may deliver the questionnaires to the potential
respondents with a request to complete them at their convenience. After a day or two he can collect
the completed questionnaires from them. Often referred to as the self-administered questionnaire
method, it combines the advantages of the personal interview and the mail survey.

   Alternatively, the questionnaires may be delivered in person and the completed questionnaires
may be returned by mail by the respondents.

   <p>
	 Attaching questionnaire to a product: A ﬁrm test- -marketing a product may attach a questionnaire
to a product and request the buyer to complete it and mail it back to the ﬁrm. The respondent is
usually rewarded by a gift or a discount coupon.
</p>

<p>
	Advertising the questionnaire: The questionnaire with the instructions for completion may be
advertised on a page of a magazine or in a section of newspapers. The potential respondent completes
it tears it out and mails it to the advertiser. For example, the committee on Banks Customer Service
used this method for collecting information from the cUstomers of commercial banks in India. This
method may be useful for large- scale on topics of common interest.
</p>

<p>
	News-stand inserts: This method involves inserting the covering letter, questionnaire and self
addressed reply-paid envelope into a random sample of newsstand copies of a newspaper or magazine.
</p>

<h1>
	Improving the Response Rate in a Mail Survey
</h1>

<p>
     The response rate in mail surveys is generally very low,. More so in developing countries like
India. Certain techniques have to be adopted to increase the response rate. They are:

1. Quality printing: The questionnaire may be neatly printed in quality light coloured paper
so as to attract the attention of the respondent.

2. Covering letter: The covering letter should be couched in a pleasant style so as to attract
and hold the interest of the respondent. It must anticipate objections and answer them
briefly. It is desirable to address the respondent by name.

3. Advance information: Advance information can be provided to potential respondents by a
telephone call or advance notice in the newsletter of the concerned organization Or by a
letter. Such preliminary contact With potential respondents is more successful than follow-
up efforts.

4. Incentives. Money, stamps for collection and other incentives are also used to induce
respondents to complete and return mail questionnaires.

5. Follow-up-contacts: In the case of respondents belonging to an organization, they may be
approached through some one in that organization known to the researcher.

6. Larger sample size: A larger sample may be drawn than the estimated sample size. For
example, if the required sample size is 1000, a sample of 1500 may be drawn. This may
help the researcher to secure in effective sample size closer to the required size.
</p>

<h1>
	Evaluation of Mail Surveys
</h1>

<p>
	Advantages: The advantages of mail surveys are:

1. They are less costly than personal interviews, as coSt of mailing is the same throughout the
country, irrespective of distances.

2. They can cover extensive geographical areas.

3. Mailing 1s useful in contacting persons such as senior business executives who are difficult
to reach in any other way.

4. The respondents can complete the questionnaires at their conveniences.

5. Mail surveys, being more impersonal, provide more anonymity than personal interviews.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000210">210</pagenum>

</h1>

<p>
6 Mail surveys are totally free from the interviewers bias, as there is no personal contact
between the respondents and the investigator.

7. Certain personal and economic data may be given more accurately in an unsigned mail
questionnaire.
</p>

<p>
Disadvantages: The disadvantages of mail surveys are:

1. The scope for mail surveys is very limited in a country like India where the percentage of
literacy is very low.

2. The response rate of mail surveys is low. Hence, the resulting sample will not be a
representative one.

3. It is also difficult to determine the degree of representativeness of a sample obtained by
mail.

4. The causes for inadequate and non- responses cannot be known, and no probing is possible.

5. Information on the personal characteristics of the respondent and his environment cannot be
secured.

6. Respondents may not cooperative if the mail questionnaire is long or complex.

7. Several returned questionnaires may contain unanswered questions and incomplete responses.

<h1>
	       7.11 PROJECT IVE TECHNIQUES
</h1>

 <p>
	The direct methods of data collection, viz, personal interview, telephone interview and mail
survey rely on respondents’ own report of their behaviour, beliefs, attitudes, etc. But respondents may
be unwilling to discuss controversial issues or to reveal intimate information about themselves or may
be reluctant to express their true views fearing that they are generally disapproved. In order to
overcome these limitations, indirect methods have been developed. Projective techniques are such
indirect methods. They became popular during 1950s as a part of motivation research.
</p>

<h1>
	Meaning
</h1>

<p>
		Projective techniques involve presentation of ambiguous stimuli to the respondents for
interpretation. In doing so, the respondents reveal their inner characteristics. The stimuli may be a
picture, a photograph, an ink blot or an incomplete sentence


   The basic assumption of projective. techniques is that a person projects his own thoughts, ideas
and attributes when he perceives and responds to ambiguous or unstructured stimulus materials. Thus,
a person’s unconscious operations of the mind are brought to a conscious level in a disguised and
projected form, and the person projects his inner characteristics. 7
</p>

<h1>
	Functions
</h1>

 <p>
	Projective techniques can help to overcome some of the following psychological barriers.

1. The barrier of unawareness: People are often unaware of their motives and attitudes. For
 example, a lonely woman may keep cats as some kind of substitute for children, but also
might be unaware of such need.

2. The barrier irrationality: Our society places a high premium on sensible, rational and
 logical behaviour. Most of us tend to rationalize. We invent logical reasons for actions
 whose origins are far from rational.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000211">211</pagenum>

 <h1>
	   page no:211
</h1>

<p>

3. The barrier of inadmissibility: We find it difficult to admit our failure to meet social norms or expectations.

4. The barrier of self- incrimination: It concerns those aspects of behaviour and feelings that
might lower the respondent’s self— esteem such as communal prejudice, superstition, etc.

5. The barrier of politeness: People. often prefer not to say negative or critical views. They
tend to say ‘all right’ for everything.

     Whenever the pilot study shows the existence of the above barriers with respect to the
problem under study, then the use of projective technique should be considered.
</p>

<h1>
	Approaches
</h1>

<p>
	The commonly used approaches are:

1. Association: “Say- ”the first- thing comes into your mind” approach is based on the assumption
that a fast response to a stimulus word, picture or question will be less guarded’ and
therefore more ‘revealing of underlying attitudes and motives.

2. Fantasy. The respondent 1s asked to guess or tell a story or discuss a picture in imaginary
terms. In doing this he is likely to reveal his own attitudes and experiences

3. Ambiguous stimuli. Whenever a subject is asked to respond to a relatively ambiguous
stimulus, he will reveal something about himself when making his response.

4. Conceptualizing. The way a respondent names, orders or groups things may reflect his
attitudes.
</p>

    <p>
	All these approaches rely on spontaneity or interpretation, and on ambiguity in the stimulus.
They should be as non- directive as possible so as not to bias the responses. They also require a certain
amount of interpretation on the part of the researcher. The influence may vary from observer to
observer. Thus, projective methods lack objectivity and the reliability and validity are rather shaky.
Yet they yield best results when interpreted by tainted psychologists, in, terms of some pre -established
psychological conceptualization. In fact, projective tests serve as a major tool for understanding
human personality, and for measuring achievement motivation as well. “If we have to penetrate
deeper, below the level of conscious awareness or being the individual’s social facade, then indirect projective techniques have to be used. ”18
</p>

<h1>
	Types of Projective Techniques
</h1>

   <p>
	 Projective Techniques may be divided into three broad categories: (a) visual projective techniques
(b) verbal projective techniques, and (c) Expressive techniques.‘

    (a) Visual Projective techniques involve use of visual (pictorial) stimuli. They include
(1) Rorschach Tests, (2) Thematic Apperception Test (TAT), (3) Rosenzweigh Test, (4) Picture
Frustration Test, and (5) Holtzman Inkblot Test (HIT).

   (b) Verbal Techniques involve use of words both for stimulus and for response. They consist of
(1) Word Association Test, (2) Sentence Completion Test and (3) Story Completion Test.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000212">212</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 page no:212
</h1>

   <p>
	(c) Expressive Techniques: The subject is required to form some sort of product out of the given
	material. But the emphasis is on the manner in which he does the work and not on the end product.
"The subject expresses his needs, desires, emotions and motives through working with, manipulating
and interacting with materials, including other persons, in a manner or style that uniquely
expresses his personality.”19

   The principal expressive methods are (1) play, (2) drawing, (3) finger painting, and (4) role
playing.
</p>

<p>
	Rorschach test: This was first developed by a Swiss scientist Herman Rorschach and was used
For diagnostic investigation of the personality as a whole. This test uses association approach.
It consists of ten cards. On each card is printed an ink blot the subject is asked to tell what he sees- what the blot represents.

  This test studies the imagination of an individual. It is also used as a supplementary test to study
mental qualities of an individual. This test requires very high skill on the part of its administrator.
</p>

<p>
	Thematic Apperception Test (TAT): This test was first developed by Murray and his associates
at the Howard Psychological Clinic. In contrast to ink-blot techniques, the TAT presents highly
structured stimuli and requires more complex and meaningfully organized verbal responses.

   The TAT material consists of 19 cards containing vague pictures in black and white and one
black card. The subject is shown each card and is asked to make up a story to ﬁt each picture, telling
what led up the event shown in the picture, what is happening at the moment and what the outcome
would be. In the case of the black card, the subject is asked to imagine some picture on the card,
describe it and then tell a story about it.

   The content of the story is analyzed, the themes developed by the subject, the way in which each
card is perceived, the roles ascribed to the characters, emotional tones expressed, speed of responses,
length of Stories, etc., are considered. On the basis of qualitative scoring schemes and rating scales
relating  to them, the interpretation is made.

  The TAT is used extensively in personality research, attitude surveys, executive appraisal, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Rosenzweigh test of Cartoon test: This was first developed by Rosenzweig. The test consists
of a series of cartons. In each cartoon are portrayed two characters; one is represented as saying
something which is stated in a speech balloon over the character; the other character is provided with
an empty speech balloon. The respondent is asked to write in the empty balloon what the second
character would probably say. The answer of respondents can be classified according to the attitudes,
frame of reference and role perceptions that they reflect.

   The cartoon characters should be so developed as to represent the situation pertinent to the
subject matter under investigation. It is important to maintain the neutrality of cartoon
characters. because it helps the respondent to identify With a character.

  The administration of cartoon test requires trained investigator and the interpretation must be
done with the assistance of trained psychologists.
</p>

<p>
	Picture frustration test: This is an adaptation of Rozenzweig test. It consists of 24 sets of
cartoon  pictures in pair. In each pair there is a picture depicting a frustrating situation accompanied
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000213">213</pagenum>

 <h1>

<p>
	by verbal remarks. A blank space is provided for the respondent to write what the frustrated
person would reply.
</p>

    <p>
	The responses are classified with reference to the direction of aggression and type of aggressions.
The direction of aggression is scored as extra punitive (aggression turned outward), intra punitive
(turned inwards), and impunitive (turned off to evade situation or gloss over it). The type of aggression
includes obstacle dominance, emphasizing frustrating object, ego defence, focusing attention on the
constructive solution of the frustrating problem. In scoring this test, the percentage of responses
falling into each of these categories is compared with the corresponding normative percentage.
</p>

 <p>
	 The RF, being highly structured and relatively objective in its scOring procedure, lends itself
better to statistical analysis than many other projective techniques. It is used for research on a variety
of problems such as attitude towards minority group, consumer response to products, reaction of
disabled towards their disability etc.
     This test calls for a thorough knowledge of psychology and skill in interviewing.
</p>

  <p>
	 Holtzman Inkblot Test (HIT): This test, developed by W. H. Holtzman, is a modification of the
Rorschach Test. This test consists of 45 inkblot cards based on colour, movement, shading and other
factors. Only one response per card 18 obtained from the respondent and his responses are interpreted
at three levels of form appropriateness. Form responses are interpreted for knowing the accuracy
inaccuracy of respondent’s percepts: shading and colour for ascertaining his affectional and
emotional needs; and movement responses for assessing the dynamic aspects of his life.
</p>

  <p>
	 Word association test: This is the oldest and simplest test. The interviewer administering
test reads a list of 25 to 100 words, one at a time. Emotionally- tinged words are mixed up with neutral
words. The respondent is asked to respond with the first matching word that comes to his mind, in
two or three seconds. As he reads the words, the interviewer records the response and the time
taken by the respondent to react to each word.
</p>

<p>
	A word which provokes and immediate response is more likely to be noticed and remembered.
than that which provokes a slow response. Speediness of response also indicates attitude strength
intensity.
</p>

 <p>
	If the respondent takes more than three, seconds to respond with a matching word then it is
called ‘hesitation.’ Hesitation indicates his emotional involvement in finding a Suitable word. In some
cases, the respondent may “block’ or give no answer, because the test word or what it symbolizes
him is highly charged with emotion. A high hesitation rate and low response rate to a word
indicate that the respondent is concerned about what the word means to him.
</p>

<p>
	 The list of words should be selected carefully so that the researcher can uncover the pattern
of responses, motives and attitudes of individuals.
</p>

    <p>
	The ‘word association’ test is easy to administer and does not need highly trained interview
However the interpretation requires someone trained in psychology.
</p>

<p>
	This technique is frequently used 1n marketing research to find out the appropriate words to be
used for advertising.
</p>

   <p>
	Sentence completion test: This is an extension of word association test. It is administered and
interpreted in the same manner. The respondent is exposed to the first parts of incomplete sentences.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000214">214</pagenum>

<p>
 and asked to complete them. The completion of sentences requires the respondent to take a position or express his attitudes.
</p>

 <p>
	The objective of the test is to provoke spontaneous response from the respondent and the first
answer reveals his attitudes or motives.
</p>


<p>
	 Story completion test: This test is an extended version of the sentence completion test. The
interviewers provides the respondent with the beginning of a story and asks him to complete. It is
assumed that in completing the story, the respondent will reveal his own attitudes and other
characteristics.

   This test is of great help in identifying and devaluating specific psychogenic needs that
cannot be uncovered by simple projective techniques.

    Highly trained interviewers are required to administer this test and the assistance of psychoanalyst
is needed for interpretation of data. The data obtained are qualitative and cannot be analyzed by quantitative methods.
</p>

<p>
	Play technique: This is used often in studying children’ s attitudes through manipulation of
dolls. A set of dolls representing a miniature life situation is given to children who are allowed to
with them freely. The manner in which the children organize dolls would indicate their attitude
towards the subject under study.
</p>

 <p>
	 Finger painting: This is a rich expressive method. A set of pots of a special type of paint is
given to the respondent who is told to draw what he likes with the paints, using his fingers and hands
variables can be measured by counting numbers of certain kinds of manipulative and approach
behaviour. Apler, Blans and Adams’ study20 is an excellent example. Sixteen aspects of finger
painting  were measured: time to begin painting, use of whole hand, finger tip approach, washing— up
behaviour, and so on. Significant differences were found between middle- class and working —class
children in most of the tasks.
</p>

<p>
	Role playing: is the acting-out of assigned specific roles for a brief period by two or more
individuals. This is used in behavioural research. An observation system may be used to measure the
variables under study. Group processes, interpersonal interaction, authoritarianism, prejudice and
other variables can be studied.
</p>

<h1>
	Evaluation
</h1>

  <p>
	"The attractiveness of projective devices lies in the fact that they seem to go below the surface,
than they can give us ‘insights’ and provide us with ‘revealing information. ”21 When used with great
care, they can be useful tools of psychological and educational research. However they do not
adequately  satisfy the scientific canons of reliability, validity and objectivity, because they are
inadequately  standardized with respect to administration and scoring and standard norms are not
available. Hence, the projective instruments need not be used, if we have a more objective
instrument to measurement the variables under study.

	               7.12 SOCIOMETRY, page no:215
</h1>

<h1>
	  Definition
</h1>

<p>
	Sociometry is “a method for discovering, describing and evaluating social status, structure, and
development through measuring the extent of acceptance or rejection between individuals in groups,
Franz defines sociometry as “a method used for the discovery and manipulation of social configurations
by measuring the attractions and repulsions between individuals in a group.”23 It is a means for
studying the choice, communication and interaction patterns of individuals in a group. It is concerned
with attractions and repulsions between individuals in a group. In this method, a person is asked to
choose one or more persons according to specified criteria, in order to find out the person or
person with whom he will like to associate.
</p>

   <p>
	 Helen Jennings describes sociometry “as a means of presenting simply and graphically the entire
structure of relations existing at a given time among members of a given group. The major lines of
communication, or the pattern of attraction and rejection in its full scope, are made readily
comprehensive at a glance. ”24
</p>

<h1>
	Origin
</h1>

<p>
	The basic principles and techniques of sociometry were first embodied in a volume entitled who
shall survive? By J.L.Moreno, first published in 1934.25 An enlarged revised edition of this book
published in 1953 covers the history, theory, terminology, techniques, bibliography and
application of of sociometry.26
</p>

<h1>
	Sociometry Test
</h1>

  <p>
	The basic technique in sociometry is the “sociomteric test.” This is a test under which each
member of a group is asked to choose from all other members those with whom he prefers to associate
in a specific situation. The situation must be a real one to the group under study, e. g., ‘group
study. ‘play,’ c‘lass room seating’ for students of a public school.
</p>

<p>
	A specific number Of choices, say two or three to be allowed is determined with reference to
the size of the group, and different levels of preferences are designated for reach choice.
</p>

<p>
	Suppose we desire to find out the likings and disliking of persons in a work group consisting
of 8 persons. Each person is asked to select 3 persons in order or preference with whom he will like
to work on a group assignment. The levels of Choices are designated as: the first choice by the number
1, the second by 2, and the third by 3. The result may be tabulated as under:
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000216">216</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 page no:216
</h1>

<p>
	The requirements of the Sociometric Test are:

1. The limits of the group should be indicated to the subjects.

2. The number of choices allowed should be specific and it depends on the size of the group
    tested.

3. Each subject should be permitted to make his choices and rejections privately without the
    presence of the other members of the group.

4. A specific criterion for choice should be used, with reference to the functional activity of
   the group.

5. Different levels of preference should be designated for each choice.
</p>

<p>
	Types of choice: Sociometric choice may mean ‘choice of persons.’ ‘choice of lines of
communication,’ or ‘choice of lines of influence.’
</p>

<p>
	Scoring sociometric choices: One method is to count the number of times an individual is
chosen, disregarding the order of choice. This is the most simple method and is widely used. The main
draw back of this method is that it is insensitive, for it does not distinguish between first and third choice.
</p>

 <p>
	 Another method is to score the order of choices: say, 3 points to first choice, two to second
choice, and one point to third choice. The weakness of this scoring plan is that it treats the difference
between a third choice and no choice as identical to the difference between first and second
choices, and that between second and third choices.
</p>

 <p>
	A third plan is to use a rating scale. Each subject may be asked to rate each one of the other
members in a five point scale: 4, 3, 2, 1,0. In this scale 4 means ‘would like to work with him very
much", and O means “would not want to work with him at all,” and other numbers representing
intermediate  degrees of linking to work with him.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000217">217</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:217
</h1>

<p>
	The results of a sociometric test may be augmented by personal interviews in order to discover
motivation for attraction and rejection —sympathy, fear, anger, jealousy etc.
</p>

<h1>
	Methods of Analysis of Sociometric Data
</h1>

<p>
	There are three important methods of sociometric analysis: sociometric matrix, sociogram and
sociometric index
</p>

<p>
	Sociometric matrix: A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers of other symbols. Sociometric
matrix is a square or n x n matrix, ‘n’ being the number of persons in a group.

    Suppose a group of six members responds to a sociometric questions: “With whom would you
like to work on such and such a project during the next three months? Choose any three individuals
The responses are choices. If a member chooses another member, the choice is denoted by 1. If a
member does not choose another, the non—choice is denoted by O. (If rejection has been called for,
—1 would be used). The sociometric matrix of choices of the above group is given in table
</p>

 <p>
	The table can be read by rows (left to right): A chooses B, D and F; D chooses B, E an F and
so on. It can also be read by columns (vertical). A is chosen by B and E; C is not chosen by any one. The sum at the bottom indicate the number of choices each member receives.
</p>

 <p>
	The matrix is analyzed by studying the pattern of choices. There are three kinds of choice. A
simple one-way choice is where one member chooses another member, but the latter does not choose
the former, e.g., in Table 7.2 A chose D, but D did not chooSe A. A mutual choice is where
chooses another and the latter also chooses the former. In Table 7.2 A chose B and B chose A;D
chose E and E chose D. F is popular, as he was chosen by all the other members, C is not popular;
no one chose him.
</p>

<p>
	The advantages of the matrix are:

1. It is inclusive, i.e., the relationship between every single pair is specifically recorded.

2. Joint relationships among pairs are recorded.

3. Only one interrelation (criterion) is recorded on each matrix and is thus isolate for scientific
study.

4. Matrices may be combined and compared. Hence, they are valuable in mathematical analysis
and synthesis.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000218">218</pagenum>

  <h1>
	  page no:218
</h1>

<p>
	The shortcomings of the matrix are:

1. It is not suitable for a large group, as it is difficult to comprehend the complexities of the
   choice relations in it.

2. It is a poor graphic device.

3. It is a poor tool for detecting cliques, mutual choices and other aspects of group structure.

   Sociogram is a graphic representation of the sociometric choice relations of a group. A graph
of the data shown in 7.2 is given in Exhibit 7.2.
</p>

 <p>
	The symbols of those Chosen most often are placed nearest to the centre of the diagram and
those chosen less often are placed progressively outward. Those not chosen are on the outside.

   One-way choice is represented by a single-pointed arrow, a mutual choice by a double-edged
arrow. A member chosen by most others is a leader and referred to as star. A member not chosen by
another is an isolate. A small group consisting of members who mutually choose each other is a
clique.
</p>

<h1>
	Advantages
</h1>

<p>
 1. The sociogram is a superior to the matrix as a graphic device.

 2. It gives a birds eye view of all aspects of group structure.

    Sociometric indices: Sociometric choices or other relations are also measured by indices. A
larger number of indices are possible.

Where CS A = the choice status of person A: ZCA = the sum of choices in column A and n =
the number of individuals in the group. (n —1) is used, because one cannot choose oneself. In Table
 How well or how poorly chosen an individual is revealed by
his choice status index.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000219">219</pagenum>

<h1>
	page no:219
</h1>

    <p>
	 Where GC = Group cohesiveness; ZMC = sum of mutual choices or pairs; 11 = the number of
individuals in the group. GC index is the proportion of mutual choices to the total number of possible
pairs. In six member group the total number of possible pairs is 6(6-1)/2= 15. If in an unlimited
choice situation, there were 3 mutual choices, then GC = 3/15 = 0.20, a low degree of cohesiveness

In the case of limited choice, the formula is:

Where d = the number of choices each individual is permitted. For Table 7.2,

 a high degree of cohesiveness.
</p>

 <p>
	 3. Social intensity indeed = acceptances +  rejections
</p>

 <p>
	 4. Choice- rejection status =The number of choices minus the number of rejections received
     or

    5. Criswell in her study of race cleavages suggests the index of self preference, based on the
actual ratio between in- group and out-group choices and the expected ratio based on the total
number in each group.27

    Zeleny28 has developed indices of sociation, social status and morale. Lundbeng and Steele hsve
developed indices of interaction and cohesion. 29
</p>

<h1>
	Applications
</h1>

    <p>
	 Sociometric techniques are widely used by sociologists, psychologists and psychiatrists in the
study of group structure, status, personality traits, leadership, morale and social adjustment. they
make more explicit and precise the configuration of group relationships, the characteristics and
composition of cliques and other elements in a larger group, the social position of individual members
in a group and the streams and points of influence within and among groups.

   Sociometric studies of communities, fraternities, schools, college student bodies, camps, armed
forces, and factories have been made. 1

  with matrix methods, one can discover cliques in groups, communication and influence channels,
patterns of cohesiveness, connectedness, hierarchization and so on.

	 Sociometric techniques are highly useful in identifying leadership, small group behaviour,
Prejudice, attitudes and values. They are also useful in classifying individuals and groups.

   A number of sociogram over a period of time may be constructed to measure changes resulting
from efforts to bring isolates into closer group relationships or to transform cliques into more general
group membership. Thus, the effectiveness socializing can be measured by the changes revealed in
the sociogram.
</p>

<h1>
	Evaluation
</h1>

    <p>
	Sociometry is a simple, economical and naturalistic method of observation and data collection.
It can usually be used for studying human actions in group situations. It has considerable flexibility.
It can be adapted to a wide variety of research in the laboratory and in the field. Its qualification and
analysis possibilities are rewarding. Indexes and scoring devices are extensively used in
sociometric studies.
</p>

  <p>
	Since sociometry is a peer rating, rather than a rating by superiors, it adds another
dimension to the understanding of members of a group.
</p>

 <p>
	However, the difficulty of securing reliable information from sociometric tests and their statistical
limitations have to be recognized. They have to be used with discrimination and carefully adapted
each situation.
</p>

 <p>
	 The sociometric measures are one of the multiple means of studying inter—personal relations.
Hence, they should be supplemented by other means of gathering information on such relations. For
example, the use of spontaneity tests and interviews and the study of the pattern of acquaintance
pattern yield clues to the determinants of sociometric responses. The importance of selecting an
appropriate criterion for sociometric questions should be recognized.

              7.13 CONTENT ANALYSIS
</h1>

<h1>
	Meaning
</h1>

<p>
  Content analysis is a research technique for making inferences by objectively and systematically
identifying specified characteristics of contents of documents. This is a method of data collection and
analysis. This is used for gathering data from archival records, documents, newspapers, diaries, letters,
minutes of meetings and the like. The content of the written materials serves as a basis of inference.
The analysis is made objectively and systematically. Objectivity refers to making analysis on the basis
of explicit rules which enable different researchers to obtain the same results from the same documents.
Systematic analysis refers to making inclusion or exclusion of content according to consistently
applied criteria of selection, only materials relevant to research’ s hypothesis are examined. 30
</p>

   <p>
	Content analysis, as a method of studying communications was developed in the United States
as a branch of social psychology known as ‘Communications research.
</p>

   <p>
	Content analysis can be applied to available materials such as letters, diaries, newspaper articles
and editorials, etc. and to materials like stories or essays especially prOduced for a particular research problem.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000221">221</pagenum>

 <h1>
   Procedure, page no:221
</h1>

    <p>
	Significant content analysis begins with some systematic problem which requires specific data
from content analysis. The researcher must conceptualize the variables that are relevant to his problem.
</p>

<p>
	The procedure of content analysis involves certain steps.
</p>

   <p>
	The first step is to define the universe of content that is to be analyzed, e. g, the editorials of
newspapers on the subject-matter of the problem (say ‘sati’) under study; the publications of an
author; the issues of a newspaper for a given period. If the volume of materials to be examined is
too large, a representative sample of documents may be selected for analysis.
</p>

 <p>
	 The second step is to specify the content characteristics to be measured. On the basis of
these characteristics, the universe is divided into categories.
</p>

 <p>
	 Before discussing the general procedures for categorization, it is necessary to speCify the major
units of analysis or recording units and to differentiate recording units from context units. The
recording unit is the smallest element of content in which the appearance of a reference is counted.
The context unit is a larger body of the content that may be examined in characterising a recording
unit. For example, the recording unit may be a single term; but in order to note whether the term is
treated favourably or unfavourably, one has to consider the entire sentence in which the term
appears, The sentence is the context unit.
</p>

  <p>
	 Recording units: Five major recording units are frequently used in content analysis. They are
words (terms), themes, characters, paragraphs and items. The word is the smallest unit. The words are
counted and a list of frequencies of selected words is prepared. For example, Lasswell32 in a study
on propaganda detection, reports that the Moscow News frequently used twenty- seven key political
terms (bourgeois, class struggle, red army, the people, revolution etc.) during 1938—39.
</p>

  <p>
	 The theme is a proposition about something. It is usually in the form of a sentence, clause
or passage. Themes are most frequently employed in the study of propaganda, attitudes, images and
values.
</p>

 <p>
	The character is an individual in a literary production. This 1s used as a unit in analyzing
stories  for studying the traits of characters appearing in them.
</p>

<p>
	The paragraph as a unit of analysis is rarely used because of difficulties in classifying
various things discussed in it.
</p>

<p>
	The item is the whole document. It may be an entire article, a book or a speech.
</p>

   <p>
	The third step in content analysis is categorization. Categorization is an important part of
content analysis, because it reflects the purpose of the study and spells out the variables of the
hypothesis to be tested. Eventually recording units are classified and coded into categories. For
example projective stories written by children in response to a picture may be categorized into
‘creative’ or ‘non-creative.’ Categories must relate to the research objectives and be exhaustive and
mutually exclusive. Exhaustiveness ensures that every recording unit relevant to the study can be
classified. Mutual exclusivity means that no recording unit can be included in more than one category .
The indicators or criteria for classifying recording units into respective categories should be
explicitly specified. This enables replication, which is an essential requirement of objectivity.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000222">222</pagenum>

 <h1>
	     page no:222
</h1>

<p>
   The last step in content analysis is to quantify the materials in any appropriate form. One form
of quantification is counting the number of objects in each category. A second form of quantification
is ranking. Judges can be asked to rank the objects according to a specified criterion. The next form
of quantification 1s rating scale. This is generally employed in quantifying attitudes, and values.
For example, the degree of creativity may be rated as ‘very high, high, average, low, very low.’

</p>

<h1>
	Applications
</h1>

<p>
	Content analysis 18 used for various purposes such as (a) to analyze their attributes, antecedents
or effects; (b) to infer personality traits of speakers from logical and cognitive characteristics of their.
verbal communications; (c) to infer aspects of culture and cultural change from contents of literatures;
(d) to understand the role of the mass media in molding public opinion on occasions like general
election; (e) to study newspapers stand towards current issues like Sati, terrorism in Punjab, India’ s
peace-keeping force’s role in Sri Lanka etc; (f) to determine the philosophy of saints like Sri
Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda of Sri Aurobindo and of great national leaders like Mahatma
Gandhi, Gopal KrishnaGokhale or Jawaharlal Nehru; (g) to determine themes and values of novels
and short stories; (h) to determine socio-cultural life in ancient times from classical literatures; (i) to
measure behaviour variables like need, values, attitudes, authoritarianism, creativity and so on through
an analysis of both available materials and deliberately created materials of projective kind; (j) to
study the propaganda techniques adopted by propagandists to influence the public; (k) to identify the
literary style, concepts or beliefs of a writer, e.g., Mahatma Gandhiji’s concept of trusteeship; (l) to
explain the possible causal factors related to some outcome or action or event, e.g., the influence of
editorials upon the action of the parliament on an economic legislation; and so on.
</p>

  <p>
	Content analysis of available materials should not be used indiscriminately. If a researcher can
gather data directly through interviewing, mailing or projective techniques, so much the better. If
there is no such possibility, then available materials can be used.

	8.1 TOOLS FOR DATA COLLECTION, page no:226
</h1>

<h1>
	      8.1 TYPES OF TOOLS
</h1>

<h1>
	Tools
</h1>

<p>

   The various methods of data gathering involve the use of appropriate recording forms. These
are called tools or instruments of data collection. They consist of-

     Observation schedule or observationnaire

     Interview guide

     Interview schedule

     Mailed quesionnaire

     Rating scale

     Check list

     Opinionnaire

     Document schedule/data sheet

     Schedule for institutions

     Inventories
</p>

 <p>
	 Each of the above tools is used for a specific method of data gathering: Observation schedule
for observation method, interview schedule and interview guide for interviewing, questionnaire and
optinnaire for mail survey, and so on.
</p>

<h1>
	Functions
</h1>

   <p>
	The tools of data collection translate the research objectives into specific questions/ items, the
responses to which will provide the data required to achieve the research objectives. In order to
achieve this purpose, each question/ item must convey to the respondent the idea or group of ideas

</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000227">227</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:227
</h1>

  <p>
	required by the research objectives and each item must obtain a response which can be analyzed
fulfilling the research objectives.
</p>

<p>
	Information gathered through the tools provide descriptions of characteristics of individuals,
institutions or other phenomena under study. The characteristics may help to explain differences in behavioural pattern and performance of objects under study.
</p>

  <p>
	Information gathered through the tools serve another purpose also. It is useful for measuring the
various variables pertaining to the study. The variables and their interrelationships are analyzed
for testing the hypothesis or for exploring the content areas set by the research objectives.

  A brief description of the various tools of data collection is given below.
</p>

<h1>
	Observation Schedule or Observationnaire
</h1>

<p>
	This is a form on which observations of an object or a phenomenon are recorded. The items to
be observed are determined with reference to the nature and objectives of the study. They are grouped
into appropriate categories and listed in the schedule in the order in which the observer would observe them.

  The items are structured with possible alternatives. Space is provided against each unit observation for encircling or checking, or recording, as the case may be.

   Provision is made for the correct identification of each case observed and of the observer.

  The schedule should be so constructed as to make it possible to record the observations easily
and correctly, and to tabulate and analyze effectively.

   A sample of observationnaire is given in Exhibit 8.1.

  The schedule must be so devised as to provide the required verifiable and quantifiable data and
to avoid selective bias and misinterpretation of observed items The units of observation must be
simple, and meticulously worded so as to facilitate precise and uniform recording.
</p>

<h1>
	Interview Guide
</h1>

   <p>
	This is used for non- -directive and depth interviews. It does not contain a complete list of items
on which information has to be elicited from a respondent; it just contains only the broad topics
or areas to be covered in the interview.

Interview guide serves as a suggestive reference or prompter during interview. It aids in focusing
attention on salient points relating to the study and 1n securing comparable data 1n different
interviews by the same or different interviewers.

   There is considerable flexibility as to the manner, order and language in which the interviewer
asks the questions. If the interviewer has to refer the guide very often, it would defeat its own purpose.
The interviewer cannot listen closely and analytically if his attention rests on the guide. He may
to respond to the cues and implications of the interviewee’s remarks.
</p>

 <h1>
	Interview Schedule and Mailed Questionnaire
</h1>

  <p>
	 Both these tools are widely used in surveys. Both are complete lists of questions on which
information is elicited from the respondents. The basic difference between them lies in recording
responses. While a schedule is filled out by the interviewer, a questionnaire is completed by the
respondent. (See topic 8.2 below for a comprehensive discussion on these two tools).
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000228">228</pagenum>

<h1>
    Rating Scale, page no: 228
</h1>

 <p>
	 This is a recording form used for measuring individual’s attitudes, aspirations and other
Psychological and behavioural aspects, and group behaviour. (For detailed discussion see 8.3
measurement Scales and Indexes, below).
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000229">229</pagenum>

<h1>
	page no:229
</h1>


<h1>
	Check List
</h1>

<p>
	This is the simplest of all the devices. It consists of a prepared list of items pertinent to an object
or a particular task. The presence or absence of each item may be indicated by checking ‘yes’ or ‘no’
or multipoint scale. The use of a check list ensures a more complete consideration of all aspects or
the object, act or task. A check list contains terms which the respondent understands and which more
briefly and succinctly express his views than answers to open-ended question.1 It is a crude device
,but careful pre-test can make it less so. It is at best when used to test specific hypothesis.2 It
;be used as an independent tool or as a part of a schedule/ questionnaire.
</p>

<p>
	Its main drawback is that items may be responded in different ways. They may try to creative a
favourable impression of themselves by checking those qualities that they regard as socially desirable.

    Given below is a check list taken from a Questionnaire designed for University lady student
to study their marriage aspirations:
</p>

<h1>
	 Opinionnaire
</h1>

<p>
	This is a list of questions or statements pertaining to an issue or program. It is used for studying
the opinions of people. It is commonly used in opinion polls. People are asked to express their
responses to the listed questions or reactions to the listed statements.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000230">230</pagenum>

 <h1>
  Documents Schedule/ Data Sheet, page no:230
</h1>

 <p>
	This is a list of items of information to be obtained from documents, records and other materials.
In order to secure measurable data, the items included in the schedule are limited to those that can
be uniformly secured from a large number of case histories or other records. For eXample, a study
of annual returns and financial statements filed by joint-stock companies with the Register of joint-
stock Companies may include such items as age of the company, membership, capital structure,
capital employed, net worth, volume of business, income and expenditure, gross profit, net profit
before tax and net profit after tax.
</p>

<h1>
	Schedule for Institutions
</h1>

  <p>
	 This is used for survey of organizations like business enterprises, educational institutions, social
or cultural organizations and the like. It will include various categories of data relating to their profile,
functions and performance. These data are gathered from their records, annual reports and financial statements.
</p>

<h1>
	Inventories
</h1>

 <p>
	“An inventory is essentially a list that the respondent is asked to mark or check in a particular
way”. Some example of inventories are.

1. Lists of interest: The respondents are asked to check those things that interest them a lot.

2. List of personality traits: People are asked to check which of these apply to them.

3. List of spare- time activities: One has to check the activity engaged most often.

4. Perceived effects of T.V: (Stimulation of Activities): The respondents may be asked to
check ‘true’ or ‘untrue’ the following items:

(a) I have copied the way the people dress on TV.

(b) I have made things after they have been shown on TV.

(c) I have purchased a particular brand after seeing its advertisement on TV.

(d) I have gone to an art gallery after seeing it on TV. And so on.

 Uses: Inventories can be constructed with various purposes in mind or to test particular hypothesis. They invariably form part of a Questionnaire/Schedule.
</p>

<h1>
	8.2 CONSTRUCTION OF SCHEDULES AND QUESTIONNAIRES
</h1>

<h1>
	Schedule Vs. Questionnaire
</h1>

   <p>
	 Schedules and questionnaires are the most common instruments of data collection. These two
types of tools have much in common. Both of them contain a set of questions logically related to a
problem under study; both aim at eliciting responses from the respondents; in both cases the content,
response structure, the wordings of questions, question sequence, etc. are the same for all respondents.
Then why should they be denoted by the different terms: ‘schedule’ and ‘questionnaires”? This is
because  the methods for which they are used are different. While a schedule is used as a tool for
interviewing, a questionnaire is used for mailing.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000231">231</pagenum>


<h1>
	 page no:231
</h1>

<p>
	This difference in usage gives rise to a subtle difference between these two recording forms.
That is, a schedule is filled by the interviewer in a face- to- face interviewing, whereas a questionnaire
is filled in by the respondent himself. Hence the need for using two different terms.

     The tool is referred to as a schedule when it is used for interviewing; and it is called a
questionnaire when it is sent to a respondent for completion and return.
</p>

<h1>
	The Process of Construction
</h1>

<p>
	The process of construction of a schedule and a questionnaire is almost same, except some
minor differences in mechanics.

   This process is not a matter of simply listing questions that comes to researcher’s  mind. It
is a rational process involving much time, effort and thought. It consists of the following major steps.
</p>

<p>
	1. Data need determination: As an interview schedule or a mailed questionnaire is an instrument
for gathering data for a specific study, its construction should flow logically from the data required
for the given study. Hence the data need determination is the first step in the instrument design
process. How the data requirement can be determined?

    The data required for a specific study can be determined by a deep analysis of the research
objectives, the investigative questions relating to each of the research objectives, hypothesis, and the operational definitions of the concepts used in them.

What data are required to answer the research questions and to test the hypothesis? What
questions should be put to the respondents to elicit these data?

The outcome of this exercise in analytical reasoning depends upon researcher’s perception of
the research problem and his insight into it. If he has no thorough knowledge of the full
dimension of the subject, then it is necessary to do an exploratory ‘pilot study’ to gain it.
</p>

<p>
	2. Preparation of ‘Dummy’ tables: We are concerned with adequate coverage of the information
required for the study and also with securing the information in the most usable form. The best way
to ensure these requirements is to develop “dummy” tables in which to display the data to be gathered.
The adequacy of the dummy tables for describing the possible distributions or relationship related to
the problem or hypothesis should be examined. This will help to identify gaps and duplication the
instrument and enable the designer to make appropriate additions, corrections and deletions.
</p>

<p>
	3. Determination of the respondents’ level: Who are our respondents? Are they persons with
specialized knowledge relating to the problem under study? Or are they lay people? What is there
level of knowledge and understanding? The choice of words and concepts depends upon the level of
the respondents’ ‘knowledge.’
</p>

<p>
	4. Data gathering method decision: At this stage we must choose the method of collection
of data to be used. Which communication mode is most appropriate — face-to-face interview or
mailing? The choice of question structure depends largely on the communication mode chosen. For
example, it is necessary to use structured questions for a mail survey, to the extent possible.
</p>

<p>
	5. Instrument drafting: After determining the data required for the study, first, a broad outline
of the instrument may be drafted, listing the various broad categories of data. For example, the outline
of a questionnaire for a survey of consumer behaviour towards colour televisions may consist of such
sections as (a) Identification data, (b) Brand awareness (c) Brand choice, (d) Purchase decision
(e) Brand loyalty, (f) Post —purchase behaviour, and (g) Personal information.
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page000232">232</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 page no: 232
</h1>

 <p>
	Second, the sequence of these grouping must be decided. They must be arranged in a logical
order— For example, in the questionnaire outline given above ‘brand choice’ cannot precede ‘brand
awareness,’ because the choice is made oUt of brands known. (For further details see ‘Question
Sequence’ in the next sub-title, below).
</p>

 <p>
	Third, the questions to be asked under each group heading must be listed. All conceivable items
relevant to the ‘data need’ should be compiled. The goal of this listing is to ensure that all questions
that are required to obtain the needed data are compiled. In compiling his draft, the content, wording
and other aspects should be considered. (For details, see the next topic: Question Construction,
below).
</p>

<p>
	6. Evaluation of the draft instrument: In consultation with other qualified persons, the
researcher must rigorously examine each questions in the draft instrument. This evaluation may be
done in terms of the following criteria:

 (a) The relevance of each question to the research objectives and investigative questions.

 (b) The appropriateness of the type of question: open ended or structured.

(c) The clarity and unambiguity of the question.

(d) The practicability of the question: i.e., it should not demand knowledge and information that
    the respondent does not possess, it should not test his memory span and also should not
     embarrass him.

(e) The validity of the question: i.e., it should not be a leading or loaded question.

  The logical and psychological order of the questions, their clarity and content, and the length
of the instrument and other aspects of its structure should also be considered. The length of the
questions is likely to influence the response rate and test-weary level, but the length in itself need not
be the guiding factor in the design. The important consideration is that the instrument adequately
covers the subject, but does not include irrelevant items.

In the light of the above evaluation, the draft instrument should be revised.
</p>

<p>
	7 Pre-testing: The revised draft must be pre-tested in order to identify the weaknesses of the
instrument and to make the required further revisions to rectify them. (For a detailed discussion on
pre-testing see topic: 8.4 Pre—test and Pilot Study, below).
</p>

<p>
	8. Specification of procedures/ instructions: After the instruction is finalized after pre-tests,
the procedures or instructions, relating to its use must be specified. If the instrument is an interview
schedule, then it is necessary to specify the procedures for its use. This specification is one way to
ensure that different interviewers will deal with specific questions in a standardized manner. The
definitions of concepts and variables should be given. The procedure for recording responses and
approaches to deal with various interview situations must also be specified. The efficiency of field
handling is the operating consideration in the case of an interview schedule. If the instrument is meant
for mail survey, instructions regarding the mode of answering should be specified at the top of
the first page. The anonymity should be assured.
</p>

<p>
	A good covering letter should also be drafted. (See topic 7.10 Mail Survey, in Chapter 7. above).

The questionnaire itself should be carefully and clearly laid out, using bold types and capitals
to emphasize particular words and instructions. It should be neatly printed in quality paper, as the

</h1>


<p>
	Primary consideration 1n questionnaire design 1s attractiveness and clarity. (See sub-heading
“Mechanics  of the Schedule and Questionnaire, below in this topic).
</p>

<p>
	9. Designing the format: The format should be suited to the needs of the research. The
instrument should be divided into different sections relating to the different aspects of the problems
Each section heading should be printed in thick/ bold letters. There must be more space for the answer
of each open-ended question. There should be space between one question and another so that the
interviewer/ respondent will not easily confuse the line from which he is reading.
</p>

<p>
	   There may be questions for which answers are ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ If the respondent answers yes to
such a question, then a series of questions is offered, which is different from the series offered to ‘no’
answer. Such series must be set off spatially by indentation, asterisks or some other technique, so that
there is no confusion between the two series. (See “Mechanics of the Schedule and Questionnaire,"
below).
</p>

<h1>
	Question Construction
</h1>

  <p>
	  A survey instrument — interview schedules or questionnaire — is useful for collecting various
types of information, viz, (a) factual information - facts about the respondents: sex, age, marital
status, education, religion, caste or social class, income and occupation, and facts about even and
circumstances, (b) psychological information such as attitudes, opinions, beliefs, and expectation
and (c) behavioural information, like social participation, and so on.
</p>

  <p>
	 Once the information needed is determined as explained in the previous topic we can begin
question construction. This involves four major decision areas. They are: (a) question relevance and
content, (b) questiOn wording, (c) response form, and (d) question order or sequence.
</p>

<h1>
	Question Relevance and Content
</h1>

<p>
	Any question to be included in the instrument "should pass certain tests. Is it relevant to the
reSearch objectives? Can it yield significant information for answering an investigative question? If
not, it should not be included in the instrument.
</p>

 <p>
	 If a question passes the relevance test, we should then consider its coverage. Is it of  proper
scope? If it covers two separate ideas, then it is a double- barreled question requiring splitting. An
example of this type of question is: Are you satisfied with the service conditions and the promotional
policy of your employer? It is better to break this into two separate questions.
</p>

   <p>
	 Another test of coverage is: Does the question provide the information needed to interpret
response fully? If we have to ask about the operational efficiency of X enterprises, a single question
about it cannot provide adequate information to judge the operational efficiency. We should ask
several questions on the various dimensions of this variable.
</p>

    <p>
	Another test is to consider whether the respondents know the answer to the question. Respondent
may prefer to give some answer even if they are not aware of a topic. General public cannot be
expected to know the correct meanings of technical concepts, like net reproductive rate, Sanskritization
social structure, gross margin, gross block, etc. The question designer should consider the respondent's
information level when determining the content and appropriateness of a question. A question should
not call for more information than the potential respondent’s ability and willingness to provide.
</p>

   <p>
	A question should not overtax the respondent’s recall ability. Most of us cannot recall much that
has happened in the past. This limitation should be kept in mind in framing questions on past events.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000234">234</pagenum>

<h1>
	     page no:234
</h1>


<p>

	 Another aspect of adequacy relates to a balance between generality and specificity. For example,
to ask about average annual movie attendance is an unrealistic demand for generalization. It may be
better to ask about attendance for the last month.
</p>


  <p>
	 The main difficulties with factual questions are to ensure that they are understandable and
convey to the respondents precisely what facts are wanted.
</p>

    <p>
	The difficulties with opinion questions are much more fundamental. A person’s opinion on any
issues is many- sided. For example, opinions on ‘sati,’ there are moral, religious, legal, social and other
aspects. There is also the problem of intensity. To estimate the opinions on an issue, an opinion
statement may be given and the respondents may be asked to say whether they agree with it or not.
Alternatively, a number of opinion statements may be given and the respondents may be asked to
check the particular statement which best describes their opinion.
</p>

 <p>
	  However, if their attitudes have to be measured an attitude scale (see 8.3 Measurement Scales
and Indices, below) has to be constructed.
</p>

  <p>
	 The most important guideline for asking about behaviours of respondents is that the question
(1 be specific. For example, Questions like‘ ‘what brand or brands of coffee do you have in the
house today? Do you usually buy that brand?” are preferable to a more general question like‘ ‘what
brand of coffee do you usually use?
</p>

  <p>
	 Finally, it must be determined whether questioning would secure the required information or
not .If we find that through questioning we cannot succeed in securing the needed information, we
should  think of other alternatives. For example, in a survey of magazines read by respondents, an
unusually high rate was reported for prestige magazines and an unusually low rate for pulp magazines.
The method of data collection as changed: Instead of interviewing the respondents, they were asked
to contribute their older magazines to a charity drive. This collection gave a much more realistic
estimate of readership of both types of magazines.
</p>

<h1>
	Question  Wording
</h1>

  <p>
	  Tins is a difficult task. The function of a question in a schedule/ questionnaire is to elicit a
particular information without distortion.‘ ‘Questioning people,” says Oppenheim, is more like trying
to catch a particular elusive ﬁsh, by hopefully casting different kinds of bait at different depths,
without knowing what goes on beneath the surface.”5 As the meaning of words differs from person
to person, the question designer should choose words which have the following characteristics:
</p>

<p>
	(a) Shared vocabulary. The collection of data is ultimately an exchange of ideas between the
investigator and the respondent. The exact understanding between them calls for the use of
vocabulary common to both parties. Each must understand what the other says. Each word
should mean the same thing to all respondents.
</p>

<p>
	(b) Exactness. The words should be exact or precise, reflecting what the question content is
intended to mean. Such words as ‘small’ frequently,’ ‘good, ’ ’beautiful,’ and ‘usually’, are
intrinsically vague and should be avoided in favour of numerical ranges when possible.
Even a word like income’ should be stated exactly as ‘family income per month’ or individual
income per month.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000235">235</pagenum>

 <h1>
	page no: 235
</h1>


<p>
	(c) Simplicity: The words should be simple. Many commonly used words like ‘nationality.’
’marital status, ‘bureaucrat’ are frequently misunderstood. Such words should be avoided
and simpler equivalents used or clarified in detail. For example, a question worded as " What
is your marital status?” may elicit feelings about marital life or marital problems It is better
to word it as Are you currently married, widowed, divorced” or separated or unmarried?

 Similarly, the questions should also be simple. Instead of designing a single complex question
on a complicated subject it is desirable to compile a series of simple questions.
</p>

<p>
	(d) Neutrality: Words that cause undue influence of prestige or bias can result in inaccurate
answers. Suppose we ask a customer “.would you patronize a high— —class aristocratic cafe?
This practically would force the respondent to answer in a certain way. Such wordings
should be avoided. The words to be used must be neutral ones, i.e., free from the distorting
influence of fear, prestige, bias or emotion.
</p>

<p>
	Certain other problem areas of question wording are:
</p>

<p>
	(a) Unwarranted assumptions: The questions designer should not assume that the respondents
know or understand key words or phrases or abstract concepts. Unless words have concrete
referents, their meanings are too vague for a research tool. Example of such words are
‘business,’ ‘society,’ ‘culture’ and ‘social justice.’
</p>

<p>
	(b) Personalization: It is necessary to decide whether a question should be worded in a
personalized form or not; should we. ask “what would you do about...?” The responses to
personalized and impersonal questions will vary. We should choose that form which is
likely to present the issue more realistically. Indirect questioning is widely used for opinions
in sensitive topics. It is likely that the respondent will reply in terms 0 his on attitudes and
experiences.
</p>

<p>
	(c) Presumptions: Questions should not presume anything about the respondent. They should
not imply that he engages in the activity about which he is being asked or necessarily
possesses any knowledge on the survey matter. Questions like. “How many times a day do
you drink coffee?” or “Are you satisfied with the performance of your colour TV?” should
be preceded by a filter question. “Are you used to drink coffee everyday?” or “Do you have
a colour TV in your house? As the case may be.
</p>

<p>
	(d) Hypothetical question: Hypothetical questions like: “Would you like to...?” or “what
would you do if....?” Are of very little value to predict behaviour?
</p>
<p>

(e) Embarrassing questions: People do not like to discuss in public private matters or to admit
socially unacceptable behaviour and attitudes. For example, many respondents would probably
refuse to answer or distort their answers to questions on premarriage sexual experience,
frequency of taking a bath, or cheating in examination and the like.
</p>

  <p>
	  Some of the approaches to deal with this problem are: (i) to express the question in the third
person; instead of asking the respondent for his views, he IS asked about the views of others: (ii) to
use a drawing of two persons in a certain setting with ‘balloons’ containing speech coming from their
mouths, as in a cartoon - leaving one person’s balloon empty and asking the respondent to put himself
in the position of that person and to ﬁll in the missing words; and (iii) to use sentence completion
tests. (See topic 7.11 “Projective Technique” in Chapter 7, above).
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000236">236</pagenum>

<h1>
	page no :236
</h1>


  <p>
	 The question designer should be aware of question wording problems and take every care to
develop unbiased and unambiguous questions. After developing them, he should test and revise them
two or more times in order to improve the quality of their wordings. The general rules are that
questions should be brief and simple, without compound phrases; they should be clear, having few
or no adjectives; and they should be positive rather than negative.
</p>

<h1>
	Responses Form or Types of Questions
</h1>

    <p>
	 The third major area in question construction is the types of questions to be included in the
instrument. They may be classified into open questions and closed questions. Closed questions may
be dichotomous, multiple choice or declarative ones.
</p>

   <p>
	Determinants: The choice between open and closed questions depends on the situation. Kahn
and Cannel6 point out five situational factors that determine this decision.

   They are:

(1) Objectives of the interview,

(2) Respondent’s level of information about the topic,

(3) Respondent’s thinking through the topic,

(4) Ease of communication and motivation of respondent to talk, and

(5) The investigator’s awareness of the above factors.
</p>

    <p>
	 If the objective of interview/ mailing is to classify the respondents’ characteristics/ view points
is into some specific categories, then the closed form of question is preferable. For example, the age
of the respondents may be structured as ‘up to 20 years, 20 to 40 years, 40 to 60 years; and 60 years
and above. Open questions are appropriate when the objective is to discover opinions and degrees
of knowledge, or to seek suggestions and more information.
</p>
<p>

    When the subject matter of a question is likely to be outside the range of the respondent’s
experience, the open questions may be the better way to learn his level of information. Open questions
are also preferable for determining the depth of feelings and expressions of intensity. Where the
respondent has not yet thought through the topic, an open question may give him a chance to think
through it. Closed questions require less motivation than open ones.
</p>

   <p>
	 Finally, it is better to use open questions when the investigator has no clear idea of respondents’
level of information. This situation is likely to prevail in exploratory research or the pilot stage of a study.
</p>
<p>

   Open- ended questions: These are unstructured ones, providing free scope to the respondents
to reply with their own choice of words and ideas, e.g., what you propose to do after graduation?
open responses are useful in studies where discovery is the objective. Response freedom encourages
a variety of frames of references which may provide unanticipated insights.
</p>

  <p>
	 open questions of general type may be included in the opening part of the tool in order to arouse
the interest of the respondents. Open questions are also useful to start a depth interview. However,
they compilation and classification of responses difficult.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000237">237</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 page no:237
</h1>

<p>
	 Closed questions are structured ones with two or more alternative responses from which respondent
can choose. They contain standardized answers and they are simple to administer and easy to compile
and analyze. As the alternative responses are designed with reference to the requirements of the study ,the chances of securing relevant answers are better.
</p>

<p>
	 However, closed questions suffer from certain disadvantages. They force a statement of response
couched in the researcher’s terms rather than the respondent’s. The respondent may be led to choose
a response, even when he has no knowledge of it, or the limited alternatives may not cover his
viewpoints It IS also possible that different respondents will interpret the same words and statement
differently.
</p>

  <p>
	  Dichotomous or two- choice questions: A dichotomous question can be answered in one  of the
two responses such as "yes or ".no For example, ‘Do you own a watch’? Yes ___No.__ Do
you own or rent your house? Own Rent , It is necessary to realize that 1n many
choice questions there may be potential alternatives beyond the stated two. For example, a respondent
may answer ‘do not know’ or ‘no opinion’ or even ‘in- between’, e. g., a question like “Do you propose
to buy NS Certificates?” requires three choices: ‘yes’, ‘no’ and ‘undecided.’
</p>

 <p>
	  Multiple choice questions: These questions contain more than two alternatives, e. g., Why have
you preferred this brand of two wheeler?

     — Reasonable price

    — Fuel- efficient

    — Sturdy

   — Riding comfort

   —— Others (please specify)

The list may not necessarily be all— inclusive. To solve this problem, we should add the category
“others (please specify)” to provide for any other options.
</p>

<p>
	The multiple- choice questions should satisfy the following requirements:

1. The list of alternative choices should be exhaustive, i.e., it should contain all the possible
choices that the respondents would like to have. The category of‘ ‘others (please specify)"
should be included to provide for unanticipated choices.

2. They should not contain overlapping choices.

3. There should be a fair balance in choices.

4. All alternatives should be reasonable, e.g., in a survey of industrial workers, suppose the
following choices are presented under “What is your monthly total wages?”

    — upto Rs. 1,000

    — Rs. 1,001 to Rs.12,000

    — Rs. 2,001 to Rs. 3,000

    — Rs. 3,001 to Rs. 5,000

    — Rs. 5,001 to Rs. 10,000

    — Rs. 10,001 and above.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000238">238</pagenum>

 <h1>
	     page no:238
</h1>

<p>
		It is obvious that the last three choices are not reasonable in the light of our general
knowledge about industrial wages in India.
</p>

<p>
	5. The choices should be logically consistent, i.e., they should not mix-up causes and effects,
    e.g., in your opinion what are the two main causes for industrial sickness?

— (a) inefficient management

— (b) inadequate capital

—— (c) obsolete technology

— (d) technical insolvency

— (e) others, please specify.

Item (d) is the effect of (b), and hence not consistent.
</p>

<p>
	6. The choices should be conceptually unidimensional, i.e., they should refer to the different
aspects of the same conceptual dimension, e.g., for a question relating to low labour
productivity, the list of alternatives should not include items like (a) insufficient capital,
(b) lack of demand for the product, and (c) severe competition which represent conceptual
dimensions different from “labour productivity.”
</p>

    <p>
	This actual process of designing satisfactory alternative responses to multiple choice questions
calls for repeated pre-tests and revisions.
</p>

  <p>
	 Declarative questions: A declarative question is a type of multiple choice question in which
a series of statements about a given subject is given. The respondent is asked to check one of them
Which represents his view, e.g.,

   Which of the following statements best describes your company’s philosophy?

   A business firm is responsible for making a profit and helping to solve social problems
  which it may directly create.

   A business ﬁrm is responsible for making profit while abiding by legal requirements.

  In addition to making profit, a ﬁrm should help to solve social problems, as long as
   there is some profit potential.

   In addition to making a profit, a firm should help to solve social problems around it,
   even if there is probably no profit potential.

   When the responses are best expressed in degrees of agreement or disagreement or like or
dislike, declarative form should be considered.
</p>

<h1>
	Types  Questions to be Avoided
</h1>

<p>
	The question designer should avoid the following types of questions.

(a) Leading questions. A leading question is one that is worded in such a way as to influence
the respondent to give a certain answer. It does not elicit an accurate answer or correct view
point of the respondent. Examples of leading questions are:

 “Are you against giving too much power to the trade unions?”

“You would like to own a new Maruthi Car, wouldn’t you?”
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000239">239</pagenum>

  <h1>
	 page no:239
</h1>

<p>
“Don’t you think that yesterday’s T.V. drama was thrilling”?

“Do you think that the Government should get involved in...?”
</p>

<p>
	(b) ‘Loaded’ questions: A ‘loaded’ question is one that contains words which are emotionally
coloured and suggests an automatic feeling of approval or disapproval. Words such as
‘starvation’, ‘bureaucracy’, ‘terrorist,’ etc., make respondents react not so much to the issue
posed by the question as to the loaded phrase itself. Consider the following two question;
“Mahatma Gandhi has always advocated religious harmony. Do you think that we should
maintain religious harmony?” and “Fundamentalists have advocated religious harmony. Do
you think we should maintain religious harmony?” These two questions are loaded in
different directions. More respondents will tend to agree with the first. Another example
“Have you ever tried to get special favours from a business establishment by pressuring
them? Yes __ No .” The respondent cannot answer ‘yes’ without putting  himself
in a bad light.
</p>

<p>
	(c) Ambiguous questions: An ambiguous question is one that does not have a clear meaning.
It may mean different things to different people, e.g., Are you interested in a small house?
What does the word. ‘interested’ mean: to own or to hire? What does the word ‘small’ mean?
</p>

<p>
	d) Double -barreled questions: “They contain two or more different ideas or references, e.g.,
Do you favour or oppose increased job security and productivity- linked wage system? this
should be split up into two questions: (1) Do you favour or oppose increased job security
(2) Do you favour or oppose productivity-linked wage system?
</p>

<p>
	(e) Long questions: When questions become long they often become ambiguous and confusing.
For example, the question “Do you have any impairments or handicapped conditions, even
though they may not interfere with your usual activities?” causes confusion. It can be split
into two points.
</p>

(<p>
	f) Avoid double negative: A question with a double negative will cause confusion. Hence,
double negative construction should be avoided.
</p>

<h1>
	Question Order or Sequence
</h1>

   <p>
	 The order in which questions are arranged in a schedule/ questionnaire is as important as question
wording. It has two major implications. First, an appropriate sequence can ease the respondent’s task
in answering. Second, the sequence can either create or avoid bias due to context effects, i.e.,
effects of preceding qUestions on the response to later questions.
</p>

  <p>
	 Should the sequence decision be determined by the research process (i.e., the needs of analysis)
or by the logic of the respondent? The nature and needs of the respondent must determine the
sequence of questions and the organization of the schedule. This is the basic principle governing
sequence decision.
</p>

<p>
	Emory suggests the following guidelines7 to implement this principle of respondent orientation:

1. The question process must quickly awaken respondent’s interest and motivate him to respond
   willingly and fully.

2. The respondent should not be confronted by early. requests for personal information.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000240">240</pagenum>

 <h1>
	   page no:240
</h1>

<p>
	3. The questioning process should begin with simple items and move to the more complex, and
from general items to the more specific.

   4. Changes in frame of reference should be minimal and should be clearly pointed out.
</p>

    <p>
	In other words, there should be a logical progression8 such that the respondent is (1) drawn into
the questioning process by awakening his interest, (2) not affronted by an early and sudden request
for personal information, (3) easily brought along items which are simple to answer to those which
are complex (4) never asked to give an answer which could be embarrassing without being given an
opportunity to explain, and (5) brought smoothly from one frame of reference to another rather than
made to jump back and forth.
</p>

   <p>
	The question sequencing has two dimensions: (1) overall sequence, i.e., the sequence among
topical areas within the instrument, and (2) intra sequence, i.e., sequence within a topical area.
</p>

   <p>
	 Overall sequence: The researcher is a stranger to respondents, and the latter are under no
obligation to oblige. They may also have some dOubts about their competence to answer research
questions. Therefore, the investigator’s first challenge is to awaken the respondents’ interest in the
study and motivate participation. In order to bring this about, the instrument should begin with
attention- catching non- -controversial and simple but interesting questions. If these questions have
human interest value so much the better. In fact, the first few questions may set the tone of the
entire questioning process.
</p>

   <p>
	Two forms of error are common in this respect. One is the common practice of beginning the
instrument with easy- t-o- -answer background information like age, education, religion, occupation,
martial status etc. This practice is not correct, because people do not normally like to furnish such
data to a stranger. These items should be put at the end. At that stage respondents are ordinarily more
willing to give such personal information, and even if they are not, nothing much would be lost, as
data on Vital items would have been furnished.
</p>
<p>

    Another practice of listing private or sensitive questions at the start is also dangerous. Then
more  respondents will either refuse to answer or furnish incorrect or evasive responses.
</p>

   <p>
	 Some examples of reasonable opening questions are given below:

(i) (For a study involving household financial matters): “There has been a lot of talk about
rising prices. We are interested in knowing how people are getting along financially these.
days. To what extent your financial position has been hit by rising prices? - Very much,
somewhat, not too much Or not at all?”

(ii) (For a study involving dealership survey): “There has been much talk about industrial
deregulation and the emerging competitive market situation. It is said that industrial marketing
has become highly challenging. We are interested in knowing how long-standing dealers
like you manage this challenging task. How do you find this emerging scenario? Highly
competitive, moderately competitive? Is it both an opportunity and a challenge?”

    Questions like these may invoke the respondent’s interest, put him at ease and build up his
confidence and motivate his participation.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000241">241</pagenum>

 <h1>
	   page no:241
</h1>

       <p>
	Following a few general initial questions of the sort just described, the main questions should
be arranged in a logical manner, moving from topic to topic.
</p>

     <p>
	The principle of logical progression should be followed in arranging the topics, i.e., to place
simple topics first and to move progressively to more complex ones and sensitive topics may be kept
at the end.
</p>

     <p>
	 Questions related to a particular topic should be kept together. The respondents are confused and
angered if questions skip around from topic to topic, as when one question about tax policy, the next
about job satisfaction and the next about investment preference. The respondent’s comprehension and
ability to answer the questions will be facilitated by keeping topically related questions together.
Moreover each topic area should be linked in the respondent’s mind to the overall purpose of the
study. Questions with no connection to the topic are bound to arouse suspicion and resentment.
</p>

   <p>
	 The next aspect is transition from one topic to another. This transition should be smooth and
meaningful. Where one topic ends, it is advisable to give a sentence or two indicating the break and
the relevance of the new tOpic to the study purpose. Such transitional statements should be simple and
appropriate, e. g., (1) “We have been talking so far about your profession. Now I would like to learn
about your association with social organization.” (2) “An important part of understanding people's
attitude towards social security has to do with their feelings about achievement from work. So next
I would like to ask some questions about your thoughts and plans on retirement.” To introduce the
personal background items like age, education, income etc., the following transitional statement may
be used:” In study of this type, it is desirable to compare the people’s opinions, or attitudes with their
characteristics like age, religion, education etc. So finally I would like to ask some questions about
yourself to help interpret the study results.” Sensitive questions demand particular attention to
transitions  to ensure that respondents understand their relevance to the research purpose.
</p>

   <p>
	 Where the schedule/ questionnaire is long, the problem of respondent fatigue will arise. The
usually sets in within a period of 15 to 20 minutes or after about 90 items. When the respondent
experiences fatigue, he may fail to recall the latter items and hence give negative or ‘don’t know’
responses. The best solution to this problem is to have more than one sitting with the respondent at
his convenience.
</p>
<p>

     Intra sequence: There are two general patterns in arranging the questions within a specific
topical area. They are: the funnel sequence and the inverted funnel sequence The funnel sequence
refers to the procedure of listing the most general question first and following it with increasing
specific and detailed questions. The general question introduces the general subject and from  the
respondent’s answer to it, we can probably infer his frame of reference. Each successive question is
related to the previous question and it is progressively more specific. For example, if one were
interested in finding out how the job and working conditions influence workers’ attitude tow 11
wage structure, the following questions can form a funnel sequence: (1) “What is the job you hold?
(2) What are the activities involved in it? (3) Do you find your job pleasant or tedious? (4) Under
what working conditions do you perform those activities? (5) Do you find the working conditions
conducive to work? (6) What is the wage structure pertaining to your job? (7) Do you find it
commensurate with the nature of the job and working conditions?”
</p>

   <p>
	 The objective of funnel approach is to learn the respondent’s frame of reference and to extract
the full range of desired information without the distortion effect 0f earlier questions on latter ones.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000242">242</pagenum>

  <h1>
	 page no:242
</h1>

<p>
	 In the inverted funnel sequence, narrower questions are followed by broader ones. If the purpose
is to obtain a generalization in the form of a judgement regarding a concrete situation, and it seems
that the respondents do not hold considered opinions about it, then it is helpful to begin with specific
Questions which are easier to answer, and in answering them, the respondent 18 led towards forming
considered opinion on the broad question.
</p>

<p>
   Another requirement in arranging questions is to avoid context effects, i.e., the influence of one
question on another. For example, in a survey made for determining the relative popularity of a certain
brand of a product, if an earlier question mentions the name of that brand or in any way indicates
that the makers of that brand are interested in the findings, all the answers to the remaining questions
are likely to be biased towards favouring that brand, because, ordinarily respondents would prefer to
be pleasant to the investigator. Such sequence effect should be kept in mind in arranging questions.
Any question that will prejudice the answers of other related questions should not precede the latter.
</p>

<p>
    Checklist: Kornhauser9 has prepared a useful checklist of points to be considered while evaluating
the questions constructed. An outline of those points is given below:
</p>

<h1>
	Questions Content
</h1>

 <p>
	 Is this question necessary for clear understanding; just how will it be used?

     Are several questions needed on the subject matter of this one question?

     Do the respondents have the information necessary to answer the question?

    Does the question need to be more concrete, more specific and more closely related to
     respondent’s experience?

    Is the question content sufficiently general and free from spurious concreteness and
    specificity?

   Is the question content biased or loaded in one direction —- without accompanying
   questions to balance the emphasis?
</p>

<h1>
	Question Wording
</h1>

 <p>
	 Do the questions contain difficult or unclear phrases tending toward misunderstanding?

     Do the questions adequately express the alternatives with respect to choices of responses?

    Are the questions misleading by reason of unstated assumptions or unseen implications?

    Is the wording biased? Is it emotionally loaded?

    Is the question wording likely to be “objectionable to the respondents?

    Would a more personalized or less personalized wording of the question produce better
    results?

    Can the question be better asked in a more direct of more indirect form?

<h1>
	Question Sequence
</h1>

<p>
	Are the answers to the questions likely to be influenced by the content of the preceding
    questions?
    Are the questions led up to in a natural way? Are they in correct psychological order?
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000243">243</pagenum>

</h1>

     Do some questions come too early or too late from the point of view of arousing interest
     and receiving sufficient attention, avoiding resistance and inhibitions?

     In the light of the above evaluation, the draft questions should be revised and improved.

<h1>
   	Reason Analysis
</h1>

   <p>
	 The construction of questions to determine the ‘reasons. for’ an action or opinion poses a
challenge to the question designer. A. simple “Why” question, though easy to use, is totally inadequate
for the purpose. One effective approach for determining causal factors is ‘reason analysis.’ This is
defined as “a set of procedures used in survey research to construct a causal explanation for the
actions, decision, or intentions of individuals.”10  Reason analysis can be used 1n studying the
subjective factors in any course of individual action.
</p>

    <p>
	 To employ reason analysis, a researcher must analyze the research objectives and the type of
actions of opinion under study. In the context of this analyst he should set up an accounting scheme.
This scheme is an organized list of factors that are believed to be relevant causes or influence
some action, opinion or intention. Zeisel refers to these factors as “dimensions of the action or attitude
under study.”11 For example, purchase propositions can be analyzed with a three- dimension accounting
scheme: (1) respondent’s motives prior to the decision to buy, (2) attributes of the product- its
quality, its usefulness, price etc., (3) influences that affect the course of the decision.
</p>

    <p>
	 The accounting scheme must reflect the specific objectives of the study and also include the
time element. Questions, then, may be designed covering the various dimensions of the accounting
scheme. When done in this manner, substantial causal information can be secured.
</p>

<h1>
	Mechanics of the Schedule and Questionnaire
</h1>

   <p>
	 In addition to question wording and question construction, the mechanics of the form should
also be considered in the design of a schedule/ questionnaire. The mechanics of the form has several
aspects; items of the form, instruction, pre-coding, sectionalization, spacing, paper, printing,
margins, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Items of the form: The following items are mandatory for schedules and questionnaires.

1. The name of the organization collecting the data should appear at the top of front page. The
name of the sponsor, of the study, if any should also be shown. If the instruments are to
be returned by mail, the address to which they are to be sent must be clearly specified.

2. The title of the study should appear in large print next to the name of the organization on
the first page. Below this title, the title of the tool — e. g., ‘Schedule for consumers’ — may
be noted.

3. The confidentialness of the data should be made clear.

4. A place for writing the date of filling in the form should be provided.

5. A serial number to each copy of the tool may be assigned.

6. The pages of the instrument should be numbered.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000244">244</pagenum>

 <h1>
	page no: 244
</h1>

 <p>
	  Instructions: In the face sheet below the title of the questionnaire, a brief statement of the
objective of the study, the confidentialness of the data, and instructions relating to answering the
Questions may be provided.
</p>

  <p>
	 Pre-coding: Items in the tool should be pre-coded so as to facilitate transcription of data. For
example items in Section 1 may be numbered as 1.1,1.2,1.3 and so on, and in Section 2 as 2.1, 2.2, 2.3
.and so on. Sufficient space may be left for coding the responses to the open -ended questions.
</p>

  <p>
	 Sectionalization: There should be a separate section for each topical area. For example, a
questionnaire for studying the management of distribution channels in an equipment manufacturing
industry may consist of sections entitled (1) Production, (2) Marketing channels: General, (3) Company’ s
own ales outlets, (4) Marketing through Dealers, (5) Marketing through agents, (6) General Information
.Section heading may be printed 1n thick/ block letters. Sections should be given serial numbers:1,2 ,3..and so on.
</p>

<p>
	   As noted earlier, in order to make the shift from one section to another, it is desirable to insert transitional statements, such as “we have been talking about..., now, would you mind letting me ask
a few questions about...?” Any such statements should be set off spatially or a different type face
used, in order to draw the attention (if the interviewer/ respondent to the item.
</p>

  <p>
	 Spacing: For each open-ended question, an adequate space should be provided for answer.
There should be indeed more space than seems necessary, for some interviewers/respondents may
write in a large script for legibility. Moreover, liberal spacing is a stimulus for the questionnaire
respondent to write more fully. Even short- answer questions should be spaced, so that the
interviewers/ respondent will not easily confuse the line, from which he is reading.
</p>

    <p>
	At times, there are additional facts to be recorded after the interviewers leave the respondent:
type of dwelling or neighbourhood, the respondent’s response, etc. For recording such items of
information in a systematic manner the face sheet or end sheet of the schedule may be set aside. In
the case of a mailed questionnaire, in the end sheet space may be provided under ‘General remarks’
with a note: “Please furnish any other information relevant to the study".
</p>

   <p>
	Paper: The paper used for mimeographing/ printing should, be of good quality.
</p>

    <p>
	 Printing: Mailed questionnaire should necessarily be printed in order to make it attractive and
to minimize the postal expenditure. If a large number of copies are required, then even interview
schedule may be printed Printing has its own advantages. The letter size and colour may be varied
in printing with advantageous effects. For example, section headings, could be printed in bold- -type,
questions in one colour, instructions in another colour and so on.
</p>

  <p>
	 Margins: One inch margin on the left side of the sheet and one-half inch margin on other sides
may be provided. If the instrument is to be bound, left- side margin should conform to the type of
binding used.
</p>

   <p>
	 Indentation: This is required for ‘yes’ or ‘no’ questions. If the respondent’s answer is ‘yes’,
then a series of questions is offered. If the answer is ‘no’ a different series of questions is
offered. Such series must be set off spatially as under:

   If yes then please answer the following questions.

   If your answer is ‘No’ to Question...

   The above demarcation avoids confusion between the two series.
</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page000245">245</pagenum>

<h1>
	    page no:245
</h1>

<p>
	 Note of thanks: A final note or comment of thanks for the cooperation of the respondent should
be included at the end of the instrument.
</p>

<h1>
  	  Concluding Remarks
</h1>

  <p>
	 Question designing remains primarily a matter of common sense and experience and of avoiding
known pitfalls, as there are no hard and fast rules relating to it. Hence, alternative versions of
questions must be rigorously tested in pre-tests. Test- revision- retests play a crucial role in
questionnaire construction.
</p>

<h1>
	Summary of Characteristics of a Good Schedule/ Questionnaire
</h1>

<p>
	The construction and use of schedules and questionnaires has been discussed at length in this
and the preceding chapter. A summary of the main characteristics of a good schedule/ questionnaire
is given below:

   1. It asks for and obtains all the information required for achieving the research objectives

  2. It contains questions relevant to the study and does not include any irrelevant and unimportant
       questions.

  3. It does not aim at obtaining any information which can be more accurately and effectively
      obtained by other data-gathering methods like observation.

  4. It contains no questions that are unclear, ambiguous, double, leading, loaded or uninformative,
       and long. "

  5. It contains no open-ended or discussion questions unless they are absolutely necessary.

  6. It does not contain questions which are beyond the memory span of respondents.

  7. It contains questions that can be answered as quickly and easily as possible.

  8. It avoids unwarranted presumptions about the respondents.

  9. It does not restrict the choices of answers so as to bias or distort replies to be given.

 10. Choices to closed questions are adequate, reasonable, unidimensional and logically consistent.

 11. Each question is limited to a single idea or single reference.

 12. No embarrassing questions are given without providing an opportunity to explain.

 13. Appropriate balance between personalization and indirect form is maintained.

 14. Filter questions are used wherever necessary.

 15. Topics and questions are arranged in a logical and psychological sequence that is natural
    and easy for the respondent.

 16. Transition between one section and another is smooth.

 17. Inter—related questions are so positioned as to avoid context effects.

 18. Questions seeking ‘reasons for’ are based on reason analysis.

 19. Questions and alternative answer choices are properly coded.

 20. Design requirements like margin, spacing etc. are taken care of.

 21. Appropriate introduction and instructions are included.

 22. The instrument has been adequately pre—tested and revised so as to be a satisfactory tool for
     the particular survey.

<h1>
        8.3 MEASUREMENT SCALE AND INDICES, page no:246
</h1>


<h1>
	  Introduction
</h1>

 <p>
	 Scales are devised for measuring variables in social science research. During the past few
decades thousands of scales have been designed by researchers in sociology, psychology, education,
psychiatry, ethics, behavioural science, economics, administration and other fields.12

     Indices and Scales are often used interchangeably to refer to all sorts of measures, absolute or
relative, single or composite, simple or elaborate. “Scaling” refers to the procedure by which numbers
or scores assigned to the various degrees of opinions, attitude and other concepts.
</p>

<h1>
	Scales Classification
</h1>

     <p>
	Scales may be classified in many ways”13 in terms of (a) subject matter, (b) scaling methods
or techniques, (c) scale function, (d) levels of measurement, and (e) number of dimensions. However,
there is no widely accepted system of classification.
</p>

  <p>
	 Subject matter: Scales are designed to measure (1) attitude, (2) social distance, (3) socio-
economic status, and (4) other variables.
</p>

   <p>
	Scaling techniques: In terms of techniques, scales may be classified into (a) Arbitrary Scales,
(b) Judgement Scales, (c) ‘Item analysis’ Scales, ((1) Rating Scales, (e) Ranking Scales, (f)
Cumulative scales, and (g) Factorial Scales.
</p>

   <p>
	Scale functions: Scales may have either predictive powers or reproductivity. Scales which have
powers to predict an external criterion are Predictive Scales. Aptitude tests and prediction of marital
adjustment are examples of this type of scale. Reproductive Scales are designed to arrange sets of data
in such fashion that if the research is given a single score, he can reproduce all items in the scale.
Louis Guttman has designed scales of this type.
</p>

    <p>
	 Levels of measurement: In terms of this property, scales may be classified as nominal, ordinal,
interval or ratio scales. (See “Levels of Measurement” in 5.6 Measurement, above).
</p>

   <p>
	 Number of dimensions: Scales are either unidimensional or multidimensional. Unidimensional
scales measures only one attribute of the respondent or object, e.g., attitude, opinion, job satisfaction,
durability and so on. Most of the scales used in research are of this type. Multidimensional scale
measures several dimensions of an object.
</p>

<h1>
	Arbitrary Scales
</h1>

  <p>
	 An arbitrary scale is constructed by assigning arbitrarily numerical values to the responses to
a set of questions appropriate to a given attribute. The values are summed up to secure the attribute
scale. For example, a company’ s image among its employees may be measured through the following
items:
</p>
<pagenum page="normal" id="page000247">247</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 page no:247
</h1>

<p>
	How do you regard your company’s reputation

1. as a place to work?                              Bad ------- good

2. as a pay master?                                 Bad ------- good

3. as a provider of promotional opportunities       Bad ------- good

4. For concern for employee welfare?                Bad ------- good


   Each of these may be scored from 0 to 4 according to the degree of favourableness reported.

    The total of scores of all respondents for each item may be made and studied. The overall image
may also be studied by combining the scores of each respondent for the five items.
</p>
   <p>
	 Merits: Arbitrary scales have certain merits. easy and quick to construct, specific to the content
of interests, inexpensive and quite adequate.
</p>

<p>
	Weaknesses: Arbitrary scales are based on the respondent’s subjective logic, and Scoring is
arbitrary.
</p>

   <p>
	Judgement scaling: Thurstone Differential Scale

     In judgement scaling a large number of items (statements) are constructed. A number of edges
are asked to evaluate the items and determine their relevance to the topic area, clarity and degrees
of favourableness towards the object. The most widely known example for this type is the Thurstone
Differential Scale.
</p>

   <p>
	 L.L. Thurstone’s technique,14is one of the most important methodological contributions to
attitude scale construction.
</p>

    <p>
	This scale consists of a number of statements whose position on the scale has been determined
previously to be a ranking operation performed by judges. 3 to 7 point scale 18 used. The respondent
is asked to make a (x) mark 1n the particular column against each statement, which best describes his
feeling.
</p>

   <p>
	Procedure: The steps in constructing a Thurstone attitude scale are:

1. Select the lssue (say, religion, democracy, socialism, morality) about which people’ s attitude
     is to be measured.

2. Prepare an outline indicating the areas of attitude to be measured.

3. Define the dimensions of attitude to be measured.

4. Design and collect 100—150 attitudinal statements from literature, interview etc. covering the
entire range of attitudes from ‘most favourable’ through neutral ones and to ‘least favourable?
statements.
</p>

<p>
	 Keep in mind the following points while writing the attitudinal statements:

*Avoid
(a) factual statements,                       (b) past-tense,
(c) multiple interpretations,                 (d) irrelevant ones,
(e) non—distinguishers,                       (f) all, always, none, never
(g) double negatives,                         (h) long statements, and
(i) slang.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000248">248</pagenum>

 <h1>
	  page no:248
</h1>

<p>
	* Write simple, clear and direct statements.

— Each statement should express only one thought or idea.

— Each statement should be free from confusing concepts.

5. Assign arbitrary numbers to the statements for identification.

6. Reproduce the statements on uniform individual slips of paper.
</p>

<p>
	7. Select 50 or more judges and give to each judge a complete set of items with clear, simple
instructions to sort them into several piles, usually 7 or 11 (seven or eleven) which represent
a graduated series of attitudes from “most favourable” to “least favourable.” The intervals
between the categories should be regarded as subjectively equal. The job of a judge is to
place each statement in a particular category according to its meaning, ignoring his own
agreement or disagreement with the statement. Each judge will record on each statement the
number of pile in which he has placed it.
</p>

<p>
	8. Assemble all the judgements for each statement and tabulate the sortings (a frequency table)
to determine the distribution of judgements for each item, i.e., the number of times each
statement is included in the several piles. Suppose 50 judges have sorted say, a statements
No.98 as follows: 2 judges placed it in pile No.6; 3 in pile 7;9 in pile 8; 12 in pile 9; 15
in pile 10; and 9 in pile 11. This can be tabulated as under:
</p>


<p>
	9. Draw up a cumulative graph for the cumulative frequencies for each statement. Place the
eleven categories along the bottom line, and the percentages along the perpendicular line.
plot the cumulative percentages, and draw lines to connect these percentage points. This
will give a steeply rising Ogive or cumulative percentage frequency curve.
</p>

<p>
	10. Draw lines across the graph for the median (50% of the total frequencies) and the first and
the third quartiles (25% and 75% respectively). Note the points at which these lines cross
the Ogive curve and drop perpendiculars to the base- line at those three points (See Exhibit 8.2).
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000249">249</pagenum>

  <h1>
	  page no:249
</h1>

<p>
	11. Record the median, i.e., the value of the central perpendicular, Calculate Q = the semi- inter
quartile range, i e half of the scale value of the third perpendicular — the scale value  of the
first perpendicular. The median value represents the scale value of the statement and the Q-
value or co-efficient of ambiguity represents the spread of judgement.
</p>

<p>
	12. Eliminate statements with excessive spread (Q — values). Out of the remaining ones, select
those statements whose medians (i. e., scale values) are nearest to scale points 1.5, 2.0, 2.5,
3.0, 3.5, 4.0.. .In this way, build up the final scale consisting of 20 to 30 statements with
equal- appearing intervals.
</p>

<p>
	13. Rearrange the statement in random order and print them without scale values. The scale is
now ready for administration to the population whose attitudes are to be measured.
</p>

<p>
	14. Administer the scale to a sample of respondents with instructions to tick the statements with
which they agree.
</p>

<p>
	15. Analyze the result to check on the internal consistency of the statements. If respondents who
agree with a statement say, with a scale. value of 2-O have also checked other Statements
with widely differing scale values say 7.0 or 8.0, the statement has to be rejected as an
irrelevant one. After eliminating such irrelevant items, the scale is finalized.
</p>

  <p>
	 Scoring system: Two alternative scoring procedures are used: the score for a respondent may
be either (1) the arithmetic mean of the scale- values of the agreed statements or (2) the median value
of the agreed statements. These two alternatives give Substantially the same results.
</p>

   <p>
	 If all goes according to plan, respondents should only agree with a very few statements. For
example, if a respondent is mildly positive in his attitude, then he should disagree with items that
are strongly positive, neutral or negative.
</p>

</h1>

  <p>
	    L. Thurstone’  s procedure, we are dealing not with equal, but with equal-appearing intervals,
which are psychological rather than numerical units. Hence numerically the scale values may or may not
be  equal. Moreover, the division of the continuum into eleven units is arbitrary. Therefore, we
should not think of a score of eight as numerically twice as high as a score of four and so on.
</p>

 <p>
	 One may Wonder whether different groups of judges prodUce the same scale values. Experimental
Investigations have shown that the scale values obtained from different groups of judges correlate
highly with one another, provided judges with extreme views are excluded. In practice, judges who
place more than one-third of items in the same category should be excluded. All judges will be
Influenced  by their own attitudes, but in most cases the effect will be small and barely affect the order
of the statements. It is advisable to use as judges people similar to the respondents in the research
sample.
</p>

<p>
	 Thurstone’s scales are time-consuming to construct, but simple to administer and score. They
are primarily useful in attitude measurement.
</p>

<h1>
	Sold Distance Scale
</h1>
<p>

  This was first developed by Emory S. Bogardus.15 This scale like Thurstone’ s scale depends to
a large extent on the ratings of a panel of judges in determining scale graduations. This method can
be applied to various types of social groups such as ethnic minorities, social classes, communities,
others and occupatiOnal groups.
</p>

 <p>
	 Procedure: The steps involved in constructing this type of scale are:

1. Develop a number 0f social diStance items;

2. Get them judged by a number of judges (50 to 100) in terms of an increasing degree of
  social farness or of decreasing degree of social nearness.

3. Select five or seven of those items evenly spaced according to the judges’ ratings of
    increasing social distance (farness).

4. Arrange vertically the list of social groups (cultural groups, religions, occupations or
communities, towards which a person’s reactions/ attitudes to be discovered) in the left- hand
column of the scale.

5. Write the selected five or seven scale items on the right-side horizontally. The scale i ready
for administration to a sample of persons belonging to the selected social group. The sample
scale given below illustrates this procedure.
</p>

<h1>
	SOCIAL DISTANCE SCALE
	(To discover Hindu’ s attitude towards other religious groups)
</h1>

<p>
Directions: 1. Remember to give your first reaCtions in every case.

2.Give your reactions to each religion as a group. Do not give your reactions to the best or to
9be worst members that you have known, but think (if the picture of stereotype that you have of the
religion.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000251">251</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:251
</h1>

<p>
	Scoring: The most practical methods to assign arbitrarily values 1 to 5 to the scale items from
left-end item through the right-end item (position). Then the percentage of responses to each group
at each position may be multiplied by the value of that position. The sum of the values thus secured
would be the score for the group. The groups can be assumed to stand in a rank order according to
their scores. The Bogardus scale’s assumption of equal intervals between scale points is questionable
The scale may not also satisfy the criterion of unidimensionality. However, reliability of the scale
is found to be satisfactory, and there is also some positive evidence of its validity.

<h1>
	     Item Analysis: Likert’s Summated Scale
</h1>

   <p>
	 In the procedure of its analysis, each item is evaluated on the basis of how well it discriminates
between those persons whose total score is high and those whole score is low. The most popular scale
using this approach is Likert Scale of Summated rating.
</p>

   <p>
	Rensis Likert16 was instrumental in developing Summated Rating scale based on item  analysis
Likert Scale is by far‘the most popular of all measurement scales. It is meant for measuring ordinal
attributes like attitudes. 'It is designed to measure the intensity with which an attitude is expressed. </p>

    <p>
	 This scale consists of a number of statements which express either a favourable or unfavourable
attitude towards the object of study. The respondent is asked to respond to each statement in terms
of 5 degrees of agreement (three and seven point scales are also used). A few examples from a job
satisfaction scale developed by Brayfield and Rothe17 are:
</p>

<p>

	    The numbers in the above‘ examples indicate the scale values for different degrees of agreement
“1” indicating the least favourable degree and “t” the most favourable. For positive statements 5 to
1 scores are assigned and for negative statements 1 to 5 scores are assigned. While administering,"
these scores are not printed on the instrument, they are later adopted while computing the scores for
respondents. Each person’s response values are summed up to obtain his score. Hence, this scale is
called “summated” scale.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000252">252</pagenum>

   <h1>
	 page no:252
</h1>

<p>
	Procedure: The development of Likert-type scale consists of the following steps:

1. Compose an item pool of 50 or more statements relevant to the attitude being studied and
expressing either favourable attitude or unfavourable attitude;

2. List the items (statements) in a five- point scale: Strongly agree, agree, undecided, disagree
and strongly disagree; strongly approve, approve, undecided, disapprove, strongly -disapprove;

3. Adminster the item pool to a sample of respondents, say 100 or more, who are similar to
those who are going to be studied for the survey; ask them to check one of the five positions
in the scale against each item;

4. Score the responses of each respondent to each item using scale value of 5 to 12 for a
positive statement and 1 to 5 for a negative one;

5. Add up the item scores to obtain a total score for each respondent, for example, if there are
150 items in the item pool, then each respondent’s total score will range from 150 to 750
(5 x 150);

6. Carry out an item analysis to decide which are the best statements for the final scale; one
approach to item analysis is to calculate correlation co-efficients for each item with the total
score (minus the score for the item in question), and to retain items with highest correlations.
This is known as the internal consistency method of analysis.

Here is an example. Suppose we want to make the analysis of item 9 in the item pool, the
hypothetical scores of respondents can be tabulated as under:

   Another approach to item analysis is; Array the total scores of respondents from the lowest
to the highest scores; select the top 25 per cent of the scores and the bottom 25 per cent
of scores; select the top 25 per extreme groups as criterion groups for evaluating individual
statements; calculate the mean scores for each statement among the high scores and the low
scores; Test the significance of difference between the item mean of the high-score group
and that of the low-score group by calculating ‘t’ value; retain items whiCh have the greatest
‘t’ values (i .e., high discriminatory power);

7. Select 20 to 25 items from among the retained items with the highest correlations or “t’
  values and design the final scale.

 Items in the final scale have no scale values such as in the Thurstone scale; all items carry equal
heights.

   <p>
	 Likert's scale Vs. Thurstone’s Scale: The Likert Scale is lesser laborious than the Thurstone
Scale. Likert scale requires fewer items than Thurstone scale to reach a given level of reliability. Since
respondents answer each item, the Likert scale is more reliable than the Thurstone scale and also
provides a greater volume of data than does the latter. The Likerts' scale makes no pretence at equal
appearing intervals, but by using the internal consistency method of item selection it approaches
unidimensionablity.
</p>

<p>
	Advantages: The Likertscale has many advantages which account for its popularity. It s easy
and quick to constract. It is easy to use this scale. It provides more precise information about a
respondent’s degree of agreement. It is unidimensional, i.e., all items measure the same thing. It does
not require the -use of judges. It is flexible. The researcher is at liberty to include as many or as
few items in the scale. It lends itself to ordinal measurement. ”
</p>

<p>
	Weaknesses or limitations: The most serious weakness of the Likert scale is its lack of
reproducibility: the same total score may be obtained 1n many different ways. Hence, the raw score
has little meaning or two or more identical scores may have totally different implications. Often, for
this reason, the pattern of responses becomes more interesting than the total score.
</p>

<p>
	Another limitation 15 that the scale Offers no metric or interval measures. It also lacks a
neutral point; one cannot know where scores in the middle, range from mildly negative.

    It is assumed that all items in the Likert scale have equal weights. This 1s not necessarily a vvalid
assumption. Certain statements compared with others may have greater meaning to a person. Differ
individuals may possess a given attitude to the same degree, yet they may respond differently to the
item on the scale. Nevertheless, the Likert scale is highly reliable for rough ordering of people with
regard to a particular attitude.
</p>

<h1>
	Rating Scale
</h1>

	Rating means measuring an attribute of objects or persons by judgement in a continuum. It gives
a measure of one’s actual position on the judgement continuum. For example, school marks or grades,
performance appraisal rating of an employee in an organization.

   Forms of rating scales: A rating scale may be either a graphic rating scale or an itemized scale.

    Graphic rating scale: This is a common and simple form to use. In this form of scale, the judge
checks response to an item along a continumm. For example, two items of graphic form, taken from
a teacher rating scale are:

    You are asked to rate your teacher on the indicated qualities by placing a check mark (O) at
the point on eaCh line which best describes your feeling about him. Each line 18 a continuum, so your
place your rating anywhere along the line.

   <p>
	 Itemized scale: This form of rating scale presents a series of statements (5 to 7) from which
respondent selects one as best reflecting his evaluation. The statements, are listed in a graded
scanner. An example of an item taken from an employee rating scale is:

 - How well does the employee get along With his fellow workers?

 - He is almost always involved in some friction or argument with a fellow worker.

 — He is often at odds with one or more of his fellow workers.

 — He sometimes gets involved in friction.

 — He rarely becomes involved in friction with others, definitely less often than most of the
   men.

— He almost, never gets involved in friction situations with fellow workers.


  This form is more difficult to develop, but provides more information and. meaning to the rater.
</p>

<p>
    Number of scale points: In designing a rating scale the number of scale points to use has to
decided. The general guideline is: more points on a scale provides for greater sensitivity of
measurement and accommodates various shades of opinion. Often five to seven points are used. The
between an odd or even number depends on whether or not respondents are to be forced to
decide the direction of their attitude; with an odd number there iS a middle item representing a neutral
position, but with an even number, there iS no middle point so that respondents are forced to decide
the high or low side to which they belong.

	Phrasing of degrees of judgement: Some . of the common phrasings18 used to indicate the
degrees of judgement in surveys are:

</h1>

   <p>
	 When objective assessment is wanted, it is dangerous to give such labels as  ‘frequently’
‘moderately’, ‘often’, etc.
</p>

<p>
     Problems in using rating scales: The respondents’ ratings may be subject to some errors like
the error of central tendency, leniency and halo effect.
</p>
<p>

    First, the respondents may avoid extreme positions and this leads to the error of central tendency
Measures to counteract this error are: (1) to make sure that raters have the necessary information.
(2)to adjust the strength of descriptive adjectives, (3) to provide greater differences in meaning between
steps near the ends of the scale than between the steps near the centre, and (4) to use more points
in the scale.
</p>


     <p>
	Second, certain respondents may be ”easy raters and cause the error of leniency, while others
may be “hard” raters who may commit the error of severity. One way to deal with the tendency
positive leniency is to adopt an asymmetrical scale with one unfavourable descriptive term and four
favourable terms (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent).
</p>

    <p>
	The third major problem Is the halo effect, 1.e., the systematic bias arising out of the respondent's
overall feeling of like or dislike, e. g., if a respondent likes a particular make of T.V., he will give
high rating for all its characteristics such as performance, appearance, picture clarity etc. One way to
counteract halo is to rate one trait at a time for at subjects or to have one trait per page rather
than one subject per page.
</p>

       <p>
	Another serious danger lies in the ease with the respondents can be influenced by variables
which they are not aware of. For example, when a child is rated by his teacher on attribute like
imitability, shyness, obedience etc., we may find differences because the teacher unknowingly compare
him with other children, i.e., the rates have different frame of references. The respondents are also
influenced by what they think is the purpose of rating procedure.
</p>

 <p>
	   Uses: The ratings may be used (1) as objective assessments, e. g., ratings of the quality of
furnishings in a home by the interviewer, (2) in a subjective projective way to tell us something  above.
the rater, his perception, and his attitude, and (3) as self-rating of personality traits or attitudes
. Rating scales are widely used in business research, psychological studies and opinion surveys.
</p>

   <p>
	 Merits: The results obtained with careful use of ratings scales compare favourably with alternative
methods. They are simple to design and operate; they require less time; and they are more sensitive
and informative than a straight yes /no choice of answers. They may be used with a large number or
attributes or variables.
</p>

<h1>
	Ranking Scale
</h1>

  <p>
	 A ranking scale is meant for arranging objects or persons in order from most to least with alternative
to some attribute, e.g., ranking students according to their performance in an examination, painting
in the order or merit, two wheelers in the order of fuel efficiency, etc. The basis on which ranking
is done should be stated clearly.
</p>

<p>
	  Ranking tells us the order or sequence, but does not indicate the differences or ‘distance
between ranks.
</p>

<p>
   Methods of ranking: There are several methods of ranking: (1) Simple ranking, (2) Pair
comparison method, (3) Method of Successive categories.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000256">256</pagenum>

<h1>
	page no:256
</h1>

 <p>
	 Simple ranking: In this method, the respondents are asked to rank their choices, as 1, 2, 3....
For  example, in a consumer survey, respondents may be asked to rank to attributes of an automobile
car, which they consider while choosing a particular brand:
</p>

 <p>
	The ranks may be assigned score values in the reverse order, i.e., if six items/ stimuli are to
be ranked, the first rank is assigned a score of 6, the second rank, a score of 5. And the sixth rank
a score of ‘1’. In order to study the relative importance given to the attributes, for each attribute, the
rank values may be multiplied by the corresponding frequencies (number of respondents) and summed
up. The total Scores indicate the comparative rankings of attributes (see Table 8.3).
</p>

<p>
   The method of simple ranking is usually easier and more motivating to the respondents, but the
number of stimuli to be handled should be less than 5 or six, because respondents may grow quite
careless in ranking more items. Further, the rank ordering 1s an ordinal scale with all of its limitations.
</p>

<p>
	Paired comparison method: In this method, stimuli are presented in pairs to judges and the
judges are asked to select the better one in each pair. For example, a sample of 100 persons may be
asked to select the more desirable occupation for women from each of the pairs. The five occupations
to be considered are: office employee (A), nurse (B), sales woman (C), farm laborer (D), and domestic
servant (E), The 10 pairs of the occupations are so arranged that each occupation appeared first in
as many times as it appears second. No occupation is repeated in any two succeeding pairs. The
pairs are:

1. Farm labourer (D):                                   Nurse (B)
2. Domestic Servant (E):                                Office employee (A)
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000257">257</pagenum>

  <h1>
	 page no:257
</h1>

<p>
3. Nurse (B):                            Sales women (C)

4. Office employee (A):                  Farm labourer (D)

5. Sales woman (C):                      Domestic servant (E)

6. Nurse (B):                            Office employee (A)

7. Sales woman (C):                      Farm labourer (D)

8. Domestic servant (E):                 Nurse (B)

9. Office employee (A):                  Sales woman (C)

10. Farm labourer (D):                   Domestic servant (E)

</p>

<p>
    The consistency in responses must be examined. For instance, if occupation B is preferred to
C, and C is preferred to D, then B will be preferred to D, but if occupation D is preferred to C or
B, the response is then inconsistent. Such inconsistencies may be rectified/ eliminated. The
hypothetical data of preferences of 100 respondents are shoWn in Table 8 4.

     By a comparison of the total number of preferences stated for each occupation, it is apparent.
that B is the most popular.

<p>
	 While a paired- comparison provides ordinal data, Guilford19 has developed a method by which
such data may be coveted into an interval scale. It is called the comparative- standard method and is
illustrated here.

   The steps involved are: First, using the data in Table 8.4, the columns are calculated using the
equation:
</p>

    <p>
	 Guilford points out, “The correction .5N in the numerator is for the assumed number of choices
the stimulus would have received if it had been compared with itself... .It is assumed that the standard
is the composite of all the stimuli in the series and that Mp is the proportion of times any given
stimulus is chosen in preference to that standard. ”20
</p>

  <p>
	 The calculated means are shown in Table 8. 4. The Z values for M are secured from the normal
curve tables. When the proportiOn (Mp) is less than 0.5 the Z value IS negative, while all proportions
over 0.5 are positive. These values are also shown in Table 8.4 as “Z j’ ’Since this scale is an interval
scale the zero is an arbitrary value. We can eliminate negative scale values by giving the value of
zero  to the lowest scale value and then adding the absolute value of this lowest scale value to all
other items.
</p>
<p>

   Method of successive intervals: When the number of items to be considered is large, this
method is used. In this method, the subject is asked to sort the items (usually one per card) into 7 or 11 categories ranging from‘ ‘most favourable’ to “least favourable.” From these sorting an interval
scale can be developed. (See “Judgement Scaling”, abbve).

    Ranking scales are used for stimulus- centred scaling. They are also the response fOrm of choice
with in all types of scale construction techniques.

<h1>
	   Cumulative Scale of Scalogram: Guttman Scale, page no:259
</h1>

  <p>
	  Under this method, from a respondent’s total score, it is possible to know which items be
answered positively. This method was developed by Guttman21 for scaling qualitative data.
</p>

<p>
	 Scalogram analysis is a procedure for determining the unidimensionality and reproducibility of
a set of items. A scale is unidimensional if the responses fall into a pattern in which endorsement of
the item reflecting the extreme position results also in endorsing all items which are less extreme. If
there are, say, five items in a scale, representing different degrees of favourable attitude and if a
respondent agrees to ’the ‘most favourable’ statement, he also agrees to the other statements. In such
a scale, from a respondent’s score we know exactly which items (or statements) he endorsed. This
quality of reproducing the responses to each item, knowing only the total score is called reproducibility.
</p>

   <p>
	  Likert and Thurstone scale also contain items associated with the attitude in question, but they
do not necessarily form a unidimensional scale. Different respondents may have the same score and
yet react differently to the different dimensions of the scale. For example, A and B may set secure
identical job satisfaction score. A may like his pay, and type of supervision, but he may dislike the
nature of the job and his work group. On the other hand, B may like the challenge of the work, and
his work grOup, but may dislike his pay, and type of supervision. Thus, a given total score can be
secured by widely divergent answer patterns, bringing the meaning of the total score into question.
This problem is best met by using scalogram.
</p>

   <p>
	 Guttman and his associates have developed four techniques of scale analysis to determine the
unidimensionality of an attitude scale. Of them, the “Cornell” Technique of scalaogram analysis22 is
the best- known and most useful one.

     Steps: The Cornell Technique involves the following steps.23

1. Deﬁne the universe of content with reference to the problem under study, e.g., people's
attitude towards a minority social group; people’s opinions about television advertising,
students opinions about a particular textbook; and the like.

2. Develop a number of items or statements relating to the selected topic. For example, statements
such as the following may be used for a topic on viewers opinions about television advertising
TV advertising is highly manipulative. Most TV advertising is unbearable. TV advertising
is educative.

3. Pre-test the statements to determine whether the topic is scalable. (Guttman suggests that a
pre-test should include 12 or more items and 20 or 30 respondents, but the final scale resting
should involve 100 or more respondents).

4. Ask pre-test respondents to record their opinions on all items (statements, using
“agree’ disagree.” (Yes/No) scale or 3 or five point scale ranging from “strongly agree” to
“strongly disagree.”

5. Tabulate the responses giving one score for each ‘Yes’ answer (see Table 8.5).
</p>

  <h1>
	        page no:261
</h1>

<p>
7. Locate any deviations from the perfect scale pattern. For example, respondent H has given
a yes- response to item 4 instead of the item 8. Similarly A and K show deviations. Such
deviations are called ‘errors".

8. Calculate the coefficient of reproducibility in order to test the unidimensionality. The formula
suggested by Guttman is:

Reproducibility = 1 _ No. of errors /No. of responses

(The number of responses =,No. of items x the number of respondents).

If the reproducibility is below 0.9 then the scale is not considered unidimensional.

9. Discard statements at the tail to discriminate between favourable and unfavourable
respondents, 1 e items with errors. For instance, in the above Illustration we may drop items
8 and 3.

10. Discard also items with less than 20 percent or more than 80% endorsement in order to
guard against spuriously high estimates of reproducibility.

11. If two or more items have the same popularity, retain one of them and drop others. It is
appropriate to choose items with popularities close to 20,40, 60 and 80 per cent.
</p>

 <p>
	 Customarily, scalogram analysis is carried out on one or more samples of 100 each. The number
of items tested may be several dozen. After repeated trials they are whittled down to 4 to 8 items that
from the final scale. The above procedure, is naturally very tedious and fraught with errors. This is
led to the development of scalogram boards by Guttman and others. These are mechanical devices that
enable us to move whole columns of responses in one operation, without needing to rewrite the whole
matrix. The use of scalogram boards has been described in detail by Suchman. 24
</p>

<p>
	Advantages: Scalogram analysis has several advantages.

1. It assures unidimensionality of items in measuring attitude.

2. A person’s response pattern can be reproduced, given his total score on the scale.

3. The scale is determined by respondents, not by researcher’ s subjective judgement.

4. As the final scale contains a small number of items, it is easy to administer it.

5. The scale is highly reliable, as a rule.
</p>

<p>
Disadvantages: Some of the disadvantages of scalogram are:

1. The task of designing this scale is both tedious and complex.

2. It is not suitable for measuring attitude towards complex variables like job satisfaction with
   several dimensions.

3. The criterion of reproducibility insisted by Guttman is valuable, but not an essential property.

4. The standard or reproducibility (a coefficient of not less than 0.9) set by Guttman is  SCH.
   what arbitrary.

5. The scale does not have equal or equal- appearing intervals.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000262">262</pagenum>

 <h1>
	  page no:262
</h1>


<p>
6. There is no guarantee that the items will scale and that items that do scale generally cover
a narrow universe of content, as the item analysis may lead to the rejection of items in a
way that leaves a scale of homogeneous items.
</p>

    Application: In View of the above limitations, Guttman scale is perhaps more appropriate for
scaling ordered behaviour like attitude towards minorities, students’ reactions to the teaching
process etc., than less structured and broader based attitudes.

<h1>
	Factor Scaling
</h1>

    <p>
	 This is another basic scale construction technique developed to identify the multi-dimensions of
a complex attitude. The factor- analysis is a statistical technique based on inter- correlations among all
the items in a scale in order to uncover the underlying (latent) dimensions or factors. There are  three of factors: (1) a general factor that contributes to all the items in the scale, (2) a group factor
contributes to two or more, but not to all items; and (3) a specific factor contributes to just one
item. The group and general factors are termed common factors. (See chapter 11 for illustration).
</p>

   <p>
	Uses:25 Factor-analysis is used to examine a set of developed attitude items in order to eliminate
item that do not belong and to keep items that have high loadings on the attitude to be measured.
it is also used to show how a seemingly unified attitude complex in fact “breaks up” into several
independent factors.
</p>

     <p>
	When applied to a Single scale, it can throw light on its unidimensionality. When applied to a
battery of scales administered to the same respondents, it can reveal their similarities and differences
and the underlying attitudes or value systems as well. For instance, Eysenck26 shows that opinions
on sovereignty, abortion law, corporal punishment, and religious education have the same underlying
attitude structures. Factor-analysis then becomes a tool for theoretical investigation and new discoveries.
</p>

   <p>
	 Factor-analysis is widely used with Likert and Semantic Differential items at the pilot study in
order to examine the dimensions of the attitude under study.
</p>

 <p>
	  Limitation: Factor-analysis is a laborious process. For instance, a factor-analysis of a pool of
only 20 items would involve as a first step computation of 190 correlation co-efficients. Often,
therefore, it is applied not to the original items pool, but to a finished scale.
</p>

<h1>
	Semantic Differential Scale (SD Scale)
</h1>

   <p>
	This scaling method, based on factor-analysis, was developed by Osgood27 and his associates.
It attempts to measure the psychological meanings of a concept to individuals. It is based on the
proposition that a concept (e. g., father, Mahatma Gandhi, United Nations, Socialism) can have several
implied meanings that can be located in multidimensional semantic space.

     The SD method consists of a set of bipolar rating scales, usually seven-point, by which groups
of subjects are asked to rate one or more concepts relevant to the selected research problem. Examples
of scale items are:
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000263">263</pagenum>


 <h1>
	  page no:263
</h1>

<p>
	 Subjects are asked to place a check-mark in one of the spaces on each scale to indicate their
rating of the concept’ 3 position with respect to the objectives involved. The positions are assigned
scores 1 to 7.
</p>

 <p>
	 Factors or dimensions: Each scale measures one or two or three major underlying dimensions
or factors, viz, Evaluation, Potency, Activity. These may be called clusters of adjectives.
</p>

 <p>
	 Adjective- pairs may be evaluative, share strength (or potency) ideas or express motion and
action (or Activity). Examples of adjective pairs identified with these factors are:

Osgood gives a list of 50 scales with their factor identifications. Researchers can develop scales
using these and other appropriate adjective pairs.
</p>

<p>
	Steps: The construction of SD scale involves the following steps:

1. Select the concepts to be studied in terms of the nature of the research problem: concepts
tend to be nouns or noun phrases. E.g., for studying educational environments as perceived
by teachers, we may use concepts like school, pupil, teaching, head master/ principal,
discipline. Concepts must elicit varied responses from different individuals and they should
cover, to some extent, the semantic space.

2. Select the appropriate scales or adjective pairs. The criteria for selecting scales are:

 (a) Factor composition to the concepts used. The common practice is to use at least  three
    adjective pairs for each factor or dimension and to calculate an average factor score.

(b) Relevance of scales to the concepts. It is important to choose adjectives that permit
connotative perceptions, e.g., adjective pairs like good-bad, young-old, lovable-hatable
are suitable for a concept of ‘Father’, pairs like original stereotyped, systematic
disorganized, responsible- irresponsible may be relevant to the conCept ‘Teacher.’

(c) Scales should be stable across subjects and concepts.

(d) Scales should be linear between polar opposites, e.g., a pair like “rugged — delicate"
fails this test, because it is non-linear relative to evaluation.

3. Use a separate page for each concept. Write the title of the concept at. the top and list under
it the adjective pairs in mix-up order in relation to the factors and reverse polar adjectives
at random to counteract response bias tendencies. See the illustration given below:
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000264">264</pagenum>

 <h1>
	     page no:264
</h1>

<p>
	The letters before the adjective pairs indicate the factors: Evaluation (E), Potency (P), and
activity (A) In the actual scale the letters should be omitted.

   Concepts to the rated may be single words like “Teacher”, “School’, “Socialism” or phrases like
the kind of person you are,” “by what you think they mean to teachers.”

  4. Develop the scoring plan. To give a score of 7 to 1 or 1 to 7 to scales depending on the
order in  Which they run, starting the unfavourable and with ‘,1’ and ending the favourable end with

</p>

<p>
	A scoring system of + 3, + 2, + 1, 0,-— 1, — 2, — 3, may also be used. This has the advantage
having zero at the neutral point. But this advantage is more than offset by the disadvantage of
dealing with negative numbers.

    A respondent’s total score is the measure of his attitude. Thus, SD like a Likert scale is a
rating scale.

  The average of the scores of a group of individuals will represent the concept mean. The
reference between the concept means may be tested by tests of significance. A more detailed analysis
also be made using factor or cluster analysis to measure the different dimensions involved.
</p>

<p>
	Application or uses: SD technique 18 widely used 1n brand image and other marketing studies,
constitutional images, political issues and personalities, organization morale, attitude- conditioning
studies, of emotions, measurement of attitudes and values.
</p>

<p>
	Advantages: The SD has several advantages. It is an efficient and easy method of studying
attitude of a large sample of respondents. It is a standardized technique and free from the problems
response distortion. “It is good, it is active, it is potent. ”28
</p>

<h1>
  Attitude  Scales
</h1>

<p>
	An attitude is a tendency to act or react in a certain manner when confronted with certain
It is the degree of positive or negative feelings about an object or issue. Attitude is not
observable, but is inferred from one s behaviour, both verbal and non-verbal. It can be
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000265">265</pagenum>

  <h1>
	 page no:265
</h1>

<p>
	described by its content (what the attitude about), by its direction (positive, neutral or negative
feelings about the object or issue in question) and by its intensity.

    An attitude is said to have three components:

(1) An affective component consisting of an individual’s feelings about the object in question

(2) A cognitive component which refers to an individual’s knowledge about the object, and

(3) A behavioural component which is the individual’s predispositions to act towards the attitude
    object in a particular way.
</p>

    <p>
	  Attitudes are measured by attitude scales consisting of 5 to 25 attitude statements with which
the respondents are asked to agree or disagree. An attitude cannot be measured by a single statement
because it may give rather one-sided result, but by having several statements we can reduce one-side
effects.
</p>

   <p>
	 Attitude scales are relatively crude measuring instruments and their main function is to divide
the respondents into a number of broad groups with regard to a particular attitude. “Such scales cannot
by themselves be expected to provide us with subtle insights in an individual case. They are techniques
for placing people on a continuum in relation to one another, in relative and not in absolute terms.
</p>

<p>
	The major types of scales for measuring attitudes are (a) Likert Scale, (b) Thurstone Scale
(c) Cumulative Scale (Guttman Scale) and ((1) Semantic Differential Scale. These scales have been
discussed in detail in the previous pages of this Chapter.
</p>

     <p>
	Each method has important desirable features. If we wish to study the attitude- patterning
explore theories of attitudes, the Likert Scale is the most relevant. If we wish to study the hierarchical
structure of an attitude then Guttman’s scale is preferable. If We study group differences, then
Thurstone method is preferable.
</p>

     <p>
	Attitude scales and Prediction of behaviour: Can attitude scales predict behaviour? Behaviour
does not have a simple one-to-one relationship with one type of inner determinant as attitude. Behaviour
is a complex factor and it is a function of the interaction between a person’s all inner determined
such as temperament, attitudes or character traits and all the environmental factors perceived by him
Behaviour has a complex relationship with its various inner determinants because of the influence
perceived environmental factors. Therefore, we cannot use it as a measure of index of inner determinant
and we cannot accurately infer attitudes from behaviour. For the same reasons, we cannot predict over
behaviour merely from one determinant such as a score on an attitude scale. Other; determinant
including conflicting attitudes and effects 0f envirOnmental factors may play a part. For example, a
attitude scale may indicate a person’s inclinations towards cheating, but he would probably a
honestly if he thinks he will be found out. “Behaviour IS a compromise, a resultant of the interaction
of multiple forces. ”30

<h1>
Socio-economic Status Scale
</h1>

<p>
   The measurement of socio- economic status of individuals or families is of much importance
since this status is correlated with several variables like opiniOns, attitudes, family welfare practice
voting behaviour, value system and others. This scale may cover such socio-economic indicators.

</p>

<p>
	In scoring the various items, arbitrary values may be assigned. For example, if a certain factor
telephone is present, it is given a value of ‘1’ and if it does not exist, it is assigned a value of
In cases where the factor is graduated into levels, an arbitrary value is assigned to each level.
example, educational status graded into (a) illiterate, (b) up to primary level, (c) up to secondary,
graduate, (e) post-graduate and the values of 0, 1,2, 3 and 4 respectively may be assigned to them.

</h1>

<h1>
	Pilot study
</h1>

  <p>
	The need for pilot study: It is difficult to plan a major study or project without adequate
knowledge of its subject matter, the population it is to cover, their level of knowledge and understanding
the like. What are the issues involved? What are the concepts associated with the subject matter?
can they be operationalized? What method of study is appropriate? How long the study will
How much money it will cost? These and other related questions call for a good deal of
Knowledge of the subject matter of the study and its dimensions. In order to gain such pre-knowledge
subject matter of an extensive study, a preliminary investigation is conducted. This is called
 not study.

<h1>
	Functions of a Pilot Study
</h1>

<p>
	A pilot study fulﬁls one or more of the following purposes:

1. It provides a better knowledge of the problem under study and its dimensions.

2. It provides guidance on conceptualization— identification and operationalization of concepts
   relating to the study.

3. It assists in discovering the nature of relationship between variables and in formulating
    hypothesis.

4. It shows the nature of the population to be surveyed and the variability within it. This is
   of importance in determining an. efficient sample design.

5. A pilot study shows whether the available sampling frame from which sampling is to be
   drawn is adequate, complete, accurate, up to date and convenient.

6. It provides data on the relative suitability of alternative methods of collection of data-
  observation, mailing, interviewing — their relative cost, accuracy and response rates to make
  a sensible choice.

7. It Shows the adequaCy of the tool for data collection.

8. It also helps in discovering mechanical problems relating to interviews /mailing.

9. It assists in developing better approaches to target population — as regards introduction,
   rapport etc.

10. It provides information for structuring questions with alternative answers.

11. It helps the researcher to develop an appropriate plan of analysis.

12. It enables the researcher to identify field problems to be encountered and suggests remedial
approaches.

13. It provides information for estimating the probable cost and duration of the main study and
of its various stages.

14. Above all, it helps the researcher to determine whether or not a more substantial study is
warranted. In the light of the results of the pilot study, the researcher will be able to take
a pragmatic View on the main study s potentialities and feasibility.
</p>

<h1>
      Size and Design of Pilot Study
</h1>

     The size, scope and design of the pilot study is a matter of convenience, time and money. It
should be large enough to fulfill the above functions and the sample should be of a comparable
structure to that of the main study. It should be designed so as to ensure a testing of alternative
methods of data collection, ordering the questions, wording and the like. It should succeed in disclosing the significant difficulties to be guarded against.

    In the light of the outcome of the pilot study, if it is found that the main study is worth
undertaking, then it is adequately designed on the basis of the results of the pilot study and the
lessons  disclosing drawn from its experience.

<h1>
	Pre-test
</h1>

    Meaning: While a pilot study is a full— fledged miniature study of a problem, pre-test is a trail
test of a specific aspect of the study such as method of data collection or data collection
instrument— interview schedule, mailed questionnaire of measurement scale.

<h1>
	Need for Pre-testing
</h1>

  <p>
	  An instrument of data collection is designed with reference to the data requirements of the
study. 32 But it cannot be perfected purely on the basis of a critical scrutiny by the designer and other
researchers. It should be empirically tested. As emphatically pointed by Goode and Hatt, “no amount
of thinking, no matter how logical the mind or brilliant the insight, is likely to take the place of careful
empirical checking.”33 Hence pre-testing of a draft instrument is indispensable. Pre-testing
trial administration of the instrument to a sample of respondents before finalizing it.
</p>

<h1>
	Purposes of Pre-testing
</h1>

<p>
	    Pre—testing has several purposes: (1) to test whether the instrument would elicit responses
required to achieve the research objectives, (2) to test whether the content of the instrument is relevant
and adequate, (3) to test whether wording of questions is clear and suited to the understanding of the
respondents, (4) to test the other qualitative aspects of the instrument like question structure and
question sequence, and (5) to develop appropriate procedure for administering the instrument with
reference to field conditions.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000268">268</pagenum>


<h1>
	Pretest Procedure, page no:268
</h1>

<p>
   A broad guideline is suggested below for pre-testing of an instrument. The first testing of a draft
instrument can be done among one’s colleagues in order to find out its shortcomings. After this “in-
house" testing, it should be revised and tested in the field. The instrument may be administered to
15 or 20 sample respondents drawn from the universe relating to the planned survey. They may be
interviewed or copies of the instrument mailed to them, depending on the method selected for data
collection. Test mailings are useful, but it is quicker to use a substitute procedure. That is, copies of
the draft questionnaires may be handed over to a few respondents with a request to complete them.
The researcher may meet them later and request them to comment on question clarity and other
aspects of the questionnaire. This appeal for advice may elicit their cooperation, and the researcher
can get constructive suggestions for revising the questionnaire. Whatever be the mode of pre-testing,
it is important to conduct the field test under actual field conditions.
</p>

   <p>
	The pre-test responses should be carefully examined and analyzed in order to identify the
weaknesses of the instrument. The researcher should look for signs or indicators of weaknesses. As
pointed by Goode and Hatt,34 the signs may include: (1) lack of order in the answer which may be
caused by a poor conceptualization; (2) “all-or-none” responses, i.e., questions eliciting mere stereotyped
responses; (3) a high proportion of “don’t know” or “don’t understand” answers, which indicate that
the questions are improperly drawn or vague or a bad sampling design has been used; (4) a great
number of qualifications or irrelevant comments, indicating the inadequate listing of alternative answers;
(5) a high proportion of refusals to answer indicating out of context of the question or poor transition
from one subject area to another; (6) inconsistencies in answers, (7) problem of space and the like.
</p>

<p>
	    Necessary corrections, deletions, additions and changes in question wording and sequences
should be made to eliminate the imperfections discovered.

    Often several pre-testing with different sets of new respondents are required until a workable
instrument is achieved. The importance of ‘rest-revise’ retest cycle’ needs no emphasis. Any failure
to take this step will lead to poor research results. Testing is the hallmark of a scientific research’

<h1>
	FIELD WORK, page no:272
</h1>

<h1>
	      9.1 THE NATURE OF FIELD WORK
</h1>

<h1>
The Need for Fieldwork
</h1>

<p>
	Census and sample surveys, and field studies of life situations and communities involve fieldwork
for collection of data. Initial fieldwork is done fOr pre-testing tools for data collection, such as
observation schedule or interview schedule and measurement scales. Main fieldwork is launched after
the tools are ready fer use.
</p>


<h1>
Nature of Fieldwork
</h1>

<p>
	    Fieldwork requires proper planning and administration. It consists of several activities:
(1) selection and training of investigators, (2) selection of the geographical area where the study is
to be conducted or the community to be studied, as the case may be, (3) locating and securing
sampling frames and selection of sample units in the case of a sample survey, (4) preparation of lists
of names and addresses of the selected respondents, (5) planning fieldwork logistics, (6) field operation
for data collection by observation and/or interviewing, and (7) field administration.
</p>

<h1>
	    9. 2 SELECTION AND TRAINING OF INVESTIGATORS
</h1>

<h1>
	Selection Criteria
</h1>

<p>
	The quality of data collected 1n any survey depends ultimately upon the capabilities and skills
    of investigators. Who does the interviewing is therefore a vital consideration. The kinds of persons
employed as interviewers, will vary from country to country, cultural group to cultural group, type
of areas (urban or rural) and subject—matter of the study. Nevertheless, careful consideration
should be given to certain characteristics in recruiting investigators.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000273">273</pagenum>

<h1>
	   page no:273
</h1>


<p>
	 In multilingual or ethnically diverse areas, ability to speak the language of the respondent is
essential, and membership of the same ethnic group is desirable. The task of interviewing is easier,
as pointed out by Hursh-Cesar and Roy, “when the interviewers and respondents are alike in terms
of social origin, religion, language and dialect, geographical area and can understand, appreciate and
observe common customs. Sharing these characteristics reduces barriers to communication and is
expected to improve acceptance and trust.”1 Such matching of interviewer and respondent on several
attributes is often difficult. Nevertheless linguistic competence is particularly essential.
</p>

<p>
	 The sex of the interviewer poses problems. In many societies, and for some subjects such as
family planning, interview by a person of the same sex alone is acceptable. But in Muslim communities,
there may be problems in gaining the acceptance of female interviewers. Further women interview
find it difficult to travel and stay overnight in strange places. For rural surveys, interviewers
must have the stamina to endure difficult field conditions. In such cases, men are preferable.
</p>

<p>
	The age of interviewers may be important, particularly in communities where social status is
linked to age. “Young interviewers may have considerable difficulty in interrogating their elders ,and
this point should be considered during recruitment. ”2 Generally, persons within the age group of
25 to 45 are preferable.
</p>

 <p>
	Personal qualities are also important. The following qualities can be considered when selecting
candidates:
</p>

<p>
	Honesty: Interviewers must be honest and sincere. These characteristics cannot be easily assessed
at the selection stage, but selected persons who are found to be dishonest should be immediately
terminated.
</p>

 <p>
	 Interest in the work is highly desirable. The quality of most investigators’ work deteriorates after
a time. Hence it is desirable to keep this Work as occasional assignment rather than as full-time work.
</p>

<p>
	   Accuracy. Interviewers should be accurate in following instructions, understanding the
objectives of questions and in recording or answers.
</p>

<p>
	   Adaptability. The investigators should be able to easily adapt themselves to varying Circumstances
Persons with strong prejudices against certain subjects and groups of population are obviously unsuitable.
</p>

<p>
	  Personality and temperament. Investigators’ personality should be neither over-aggressive nor
over-sociable. Pleasantness and a business— like manner are the ideal combination.
</p>

  <p>
	Intelligence: Fieldwork does not call for extraordinary intelligence. What is needed is sufficient
intelligence to understand and follow even complicated instructions and to record meaningful answers.
</p>

 <p>
	  Communication skill: The investigators should possess interviewing ability. Working knowledge
of respondents’ language and dialect, common sense and ability to make the interview interesting
are essential.
</p>

<p>
    Education is important, but there 1s no necessary correlation between more education and
better interviewing. A basic knowledge of statistics is desirable.
</p>

<p>
	    From what groups —— secondary school products, university students; teachers, social workers,
extension workers, unemployed school leavers/ graduates... Can interviewers be recruited?
Practices vary. Experiences in several countries suggest that for fieldwork in urban areas unemployed graduates.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000274">274</pagenum>

 <h1>
	  page no:265
</h1>

 <p>
	university students may be used. But the use of university students for field work in rural areas
often disastrous. Most of them are ‘elitist.’ They cannot adapt themselves to rural conditions and

have difficulty in establishing rapport with illiterate, subsistence-level rural people; school leavers in
rural areas, rural extension workers and village school teachers are more effective and know the
region, and its local dialect and mores well.
</p>

<h1>
	Selection Procedures
</h1>

<p>
	The selection procedure, may usually consist of: (1) Selection test designed to measure reading
comprehension, arithmetic ability and ability to follow instructions and accuracy in recording,
summarizing, checking and classifying data.

  (2) Trial interview. Each candidate who passes the selection test may be asked to interview a
view strangers with an interview schedule. How they establish rapport and interview should be observed.

(3) Personal interview: The candidates who complete trial interviews satisfactorily may be
called for a personal interview to study their personality, manners and temperament.
</p>

<h1>
	Training
</h1>

 <p>
	Though the training methods may vary from institution to institution, the training process
 should necessarily consist of three components:

(1) orientation course, (2) practice of mock interviews in the office, and (3) interviews in the
field.
</p>

<p>
	  The orientation course may last for four or five days. The selected candidates should be oriented
to the background of the organization and its general work. They should be told about the objectives
of the survey, its design, sampling, the type of respondents from whom data have to be collected and
other aspects of the study. The importance of the interviewers’ role in collecting accurate data
should be explained to them.
</p>

<p>
	   Then the techniques of interviewing should be taught to them with audio- visual aids. This may
be followed by specific instructions on the schedule of the survey on hand. Important questions in
the schedule should be discussed separately, giving the trainees some insight into the purpose of the
questions, examples of [adequate and inadequate responses and the common problems that arise from
interviews and the possible approaches to deal with them. Written instructions should be provided.
</p>

 <p>
	After the instruction sessions are over, experienced interviewers. can give demonstration interviews.
then the  candidates can practice mock interview in the presence of experienced investigators and
valuate the interviews
</p>

<p>
	  Finally, the candidates have to conduct interviews in the field which have to be evaluated and
discussed. In the light of the evaluation” Further instructions may be given to the investigators for
improving the quality of their work. When the field work is in progress, once or twice conferences
of investigators may beheld to review their experiences, to identify their problems and to find
solutions for those problems. It is also desirable to conduct short re-orientation training.
</p>

<h1>
	Compensation
</h1>

<p>
	  Fair and competitive compensation should be offered to the investigators. It may include fixed
salary per month, travelling allowance and some incentive linked to productivity. Part-time
investigators may be paid hourly wage and travelling. allowance.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000275">275</pagenum>

 <h1>
9.3 SAMPLING FRAME AND SAMPLE SELECTION, page no:275
</h1>

<h1>
	Locating Sampling Frame
</h1>

   The sample design of a study may envisage a multi—stage sampling. This may involve, in the
case of an urban area, (a) selection of a sample of divisions/blocks of the selected city, (b) selection
of certain number of streets in the selected blocks, and (0) selection of househdlds in the selected
streets. In the case of a rural area study, sampling may involve (a) selection of districts, (b) selections
of talukas in selected districts, (c) selection of villages in the selected talukas, and (d) selection of
households in the selected villages. Sampling at each sampling stage calls for a sampling frame or
list. The available lists are obtained from the offices of the concerned local administration. The
adequacy, completeness, accuracy and updateness of the lists should be examined. If there are problem
of missing elements, duplication, inaccuracy, etc., then appropriate steps should be taken to deal with
them. If no suitable frame exists, for any stage of sampling, it has to be constructed through
field enumeration.

<h1>
	Sample Selection
</h1>

<p>
    Sample Selection is done as per the planned sampling design. A list of names and addresses
(door numbers or any other identification information) of selected households/persons for each selected
block/village should be prepared and kept ready for use. Local guides or informants can be vary
helpful in this task. Care must be taken in selecting the guides. Persons who are reasonably well-
known and trusted are most suitable.

</p>
   It is unwise to let investigators to enumerate households from which the sample is to be drawn
or select sample respondents without careful on-the-spot supervision. Whichever method of sampling
(probability, sociometric, purposive) is used, investigators (i.e., interviewers) should have  complete
written instructions on the exact procedure to be followed for sampling in order to ensure sample
validity and uniformity. The supervisors should make the sampling themselves or carefully observe
the interviewers performing the task.

<h1>
	9.4 FIELD OPERATIONS
</h1>

<h1>
	Logistics
</h1>

<p>

	Before starting data collection work, the field operation logistics have to be planned. Planning
of interviewing logistic envisages several aspects, such as transportation, interview strategy,
food stay, timing of interview, privacy in interview and the like.
</p>

   Transportation, food, and stay do not pose much problems in urban field work, but they become
difficult problems in rural areas. Cluster sampling3 may minimize these difficulties to some extent
Some villages could be reached only by foot or bicycle. If the field work requires several days, the
place where the investigators can stay has to be decided. It is desirable to stay in a central village
and cover the villages around one after another, rather than shifting the camp from village to village.

<h1>
	Interview Strategies
</h1>

<p>

    There are two alternate interview strategies: One, to use all interviewers as a team to cover
selected villages intensively in turn, and second, to leave single or pairs of interviewers in particular
villages for several days to complete the work gradually. The first approach is called the ‘invasion".
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000276">276</pagenum>

 <h1>
	   page no: 276
</h1>

<p>
method, and the second in ‘immersion’ method. The invasion method is usually adopted in large -scale
surveys, partly for operational reasons, and partly for reducing changes for feedback between those
interviewed and those still to be interviewed, and for avoiding rumors to build up. On the other hand,
the immersion method permits interviewers to gain familiarity with local conditions and to develop
rapport with respondents.
</p>

<h1>
	Period Suitable for Interviews
</h1>

<p>
	 The period suitable for fieldwork should be identified. In rural areas, the rainy reason, planting
period, harvest season, and religious festival seasons should be avoided. The time of the day convenient
for the respondents should be identified. Untimely contacts may lead to non—response and refusals.
</p>

<h1>
	Cooperation of Local Leaders
</h1>

 <p>
	 The strategy for obtaining the cooperation of the contact leaders should be decided. In the case
of organizations, the cooperation of the head can be sought through a letter of introduction. In rural
areas, knowledgeable informant like the school headmaster or village level extension worker is a good
source of information for identifying contact leaders. Often a letter of introduction or personal
introduction by a local school teacher or extension worker will prove useful for establishing rapport with local leaders.
</p>

<h1>
	Information on Survey
</h1>

 <p>
	After securing the consent of the local leaders, the information about the study and its basic
purpose, the sampling procedure and the usefulness of the Study to the community should be given
to the people of the community. This can be done by arranging for a village meeting preferably
with a  film show to attract people.
</p>

<h1>
	Privacy
</h1>

 <p>
   Although privacy is preferable for interviewing a respondent, it is difficult to secure privacy in
a rural area. A number of ways of overcoming this problem is used. Interviewing is often done in pairs
in order to get privacy. For example, a pair of female interviewers may work together with one to
interview the house-wife and the other to segregate the mother-in-law, engaging her in pseudo interview.
interviewing respondents where they work (e.g., in the fields) is another way of getting more privacy.
sometimes the presence of a third party may be useful for improving the quality of data, for the third
party will assist the respondent by providing information that the latter is not able to recall (e .g., date of birth/ marriage).
</p>

<h1>
	Fieldwork Briefing
</h1>

 <p>
	Another aspect of field operation planning is field work briefing. This generally covers how to
locate the respondents, how to deal with non response, how to open the interview, ask questions and
record answers, whom to contact in the case of problems and what to do with the completed schedules.
personal briefing and discussion of doubtful points are preferable to impress upon interviewers
the operational details of their task.
</p>

<h1>
	Interviewing and Statistical Information
</h1>

 <p>
	Then the actual work of interviewing is taken up by the investigators. Apart from collecting data
from the respondents, the statistical information relating to the area under study has to be collected
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000277">277</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no: 277
</h1>

<p>
	from the local administration office. Infrastructure facilities in the place — communication, school,
health centre etc.-- may be observed and noted down in the area of profile data sheet.
</p>

<h1>
	Diary and Time- recorded Schedule
</h1>

 <p>
	Each investigator should be required to maintain (1) a diary to note the nature of cooperation
received from respondents, difficulties and problems faced during fieldwork, and (2) a daily time
recording, schedule to note time spent on various operations of fieldwork -— journey, listing of
households, contacting persons, interviewing, number of interviews conducted and other work.
</p>

<p>
	 Their experiences and difficulties may be reviewed at periodical review meetings and
appropriate remedial/corrective actions taken up. The time-record schedules are useful for
studying time-requirements for various operations and planning the programme of work accordingly.
</p>

<h1>
	9.5 FIELD ADMINISTRATION
</h1>

<h1>
	Introduction
</h1>

<p>
	“Successful fieldwork,” observe Warwick and Lininger,4 “requires not only a theoretical
understanding of the interview and a command of practical techniques, but also a carefully
organized system of field administration.”

    Field administration involves (1) fieldwork scheduling and monitoring, (2) supervision, and
(3) fieldwork review.
</p>

<h1>
	Scheduling and Monitoring
</h1>

 <p>
	The various operations of fieldwork— enumeration of households, contacting persons,
interviewing, checking of filled in schedules and the like and the tour programme of the field
staff should be planned properly and monitored.
</p>

<h1>
	Supervision
</h1>

<p>
	“The quality of the data is no better than the quality of the field organization.”5

    Some supervision of fieldwork is essential. Each compact region may be placed in charge of a
supervisor. He has to perform various tasks: briefing the field staff locally, directing the sample
selection, scheduling fieldwork, allotting work to field staff, attending to their queries and difficulties,
supervise the fieldwork by surprise check of fieldwork, and receiving the completed schedules from
the investigators. Weekly meetings may be held to discuss cases, exchange experiences, and to find
solutions to problems.
</p>

<h1>
	Fieldwork Review
</h1>

<p>
	The quality and productivity of the fieldwork should be kept under constant review. The main
objects of this review is to test (a) whether all the interviews claimed by an interviewers were in fact
made: (b) the interview output, i.e., the rate of interviews conducted per day and the response
rate:  and (c) the quality of interviewing.

   The first check can, be made by a test check with respondents or by sending postcards to a
sample of respondents asking them whether they are interviewed.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000278">278</pagenum>

 <h1>
	  page no: 278
</h1>

 <p>
	In the second type of check, the output of each interviewers and the response rate (i.e., proportion
of completed schedules to the number of assigned interviews) are studied. If an Interviewer’s output
and response rate are consistently lower than those of others, it may be time to terminate his services.
Certain operational standards may be laid down in terms of interviews per day, response rate, rate of
refusals, rate of “don’t know” replies, rate of incomplete answers and the like. The performance of
each investigator can be reviewed against the performance standards.
</p>

    <p>

The check on the equality of interviewing is the most difficult of all checks. The quality refers
to the right way of asking questions and correct interpretation and recording of answers. The major
strategies for this quality control are: (1) careful scrutiny of completed schedules, (2) re
-interview of
some respondent by high grade interviewers or supervisors and comparing the tWO sets of results,
(3)Observing interviewers at work, (4) recording the interviews mechanically, (5) checking of
answers to survey questions against other related data.
</p>

<p>
   In the light of review outcome, appropriate remedial action should be taken. The remedial action
may take several forms: revision of instructions, re-orientation/ re-training of investigators,
intensive supervision or dismissal as a last resort.

  All possible efforts should be made to improve the quality of fieldwork through effective field
administration.

	     PROCESSING OF DATA, page no:280
</h1>

<h1>
	          10.1 INTRODUCTION
</h1>

<p>
    Data in the real world often comes with a large quantum and in a variety of formats that any
meaningful interpretation of data cannot be achieved straightaway. Social science researches to be
very specific draw conclusions using both primary and secondary data. To arrive at a meaningful
interpretation on the research hypothesis, the researcher has to prepare his data for this purpose. This
preparation involves the identification of data structures, the coding of data and the grouping of data
for preliminary research interpretation. This data preparation for research analysis is termed as processing
of data. Further selection of tools for analysis would to a large extent depend on the results
of this data processing.
</p>

<p>
	   Data processing is an intermediary stage of work between data collection and .data interpretation.
the data gathered in the form of questionnaires/ interview schedules/ field notes/ data sheets is mostly
in form of a large volume of research variables. The research variables recognized is a result of
the preliminary research plan, which also sets out the data processing methods beforehand. Processing
of data requires advance planning and this planning may cover such aspects as identification of
variables, hypothetical relationship among the variables and the tentative research hypotheses.
</p>

<p>
	The various steps in processing of data may be stated as:

(a) Identifying the data structures

(b)~ Editing the data

(c) Coding and classifying the data

(d) Transcriptions of data

(e) Tabulation of data.
</p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page000281">281</pagenum>

 <h1>
            10.2 PREPARATION FOR ANALYSIS, page no:281
</h1>


<p>
	 In the data preparation step, the data are prepared in a data format, which allows the analysis to
use modern analysis software such as SAS or SPSS. The major criterion in this is to define the data
structure. A data structure is a dynamic collection of related variables and can be conveniently
represented as a graph whose nodes are labeled by variables. The data structure also defines and states
the preliminary relationship between variables/groups of variables that have been preplanned by the
researcher. Most data structures can be graphically presented to give clarity as to the framed research
hypotheses. A simple structure could be a linear structure, in which one variable leads to the
other and finally to the resultant end variable. Graphically, it may be shown as below:
</p>

<p>
	The identification of the nodal points and the relationships among the nodes, could, sometimes
be a complex task than estimated. When the task is complex, which involves several types of instru-
ments being collected for the same research question, the procedure for drawing the data structure
would involve a series of steps. In "several intermediate steps, the heterogeneous data structure of the
individual data sets can be harmonized to a common standard and the separate data sets are then
integrated into a single data set.

   However, the clear definition of such data structures would help in the further processing of data.
</p>

<h1>
	                    10.3 EDITING
</h1>


<p>
		The next step in the processing of data is editing of the data instruments. Editing is a
process of checking to detect and correct errors and omissions.

Data editing happens at two stages, one at  the time of recording the data and second at the time
of analysis of data.

</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000282">282</pagenum>

 <h1>
   Data Editing at the Time of Recording of Data, page no:282
</h1>

<p>
	  Documented editing and testing of the data at the time of data recording is done considering the
drawing questions in mind.

 Do the filters agree or are the data inconsistent?

 Have ‘missing values” been set to standardized values, which are the same for all research
 questions?

 Have variable descriptions been specified?

  Have labels for variable names and value labels been defined and written?

All editing and cleaning steps are documented, so that the redefinition of variables or later
critical modification requirements could be easily incorporated into the data sets.
</p>

<h1>
	Data Editing at the Time of Analysis of Data
</h1>

<p>
	 Data editing is also a requisite before the analysis of data is carried out. This ensures that the
is complete in all respect for subjecting them to further analysis. Some of the usual check list
conditions that can be had by a researcher for editing data sets before analysis would be:

  Is the coding frame complete?

  Is the documentary material sufficient for the methodological description of the study?

  Is the storage medium readable and reliable?

  Has the correct data set been framed?

  Is the number of cases correct?

  Are there differences between questionnaire, coding frame and data?

  Are there undefined and so-called “wild codes” or duplicate cases?

 Comparison of the first counting of the data with the original documents of the researcher.

The editing step checks for the completeness, accuracy and uniformity of the data set created
researcher.
</p>

<p>
	(a) Completeness: The first step of editing is to check whether there is an answer to all the
conditions/ variables set out in the data set. If there were any omission, the researcher sometimes would
able to deduce the correct answer from other related data on the same instrument. If this is possible,
data set has to be rewritten on the basis of the new information. For example, the approximate
income can be inferred from other answers to probes such as occupation of family members,
choices of income, approximate spending and saving and borrowing habits of family members’ etc.
information is vital and has been found to be incomplete, then the researcher can take the step
contacting the respondent personally again and solicit the requisite data again. If none of these
could be resorted to the marking of the, data was “missing” must be resorted to.
</p>

<p>
	(b) Accuracy: Apart from checking for omissions, the accuracy of each recorded answer should
checked. A random check process can be applied to trace the errors at this step. Consistency in
can also be checked at this step. The cross verification to a few related responses would help
checking for consistency in responses. The reliability of the data set would heavily depend on this
of error correction. While clear inconsistencies should be rectified in the data sets, fake
responses could be dropped from the data sets.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000283">283</pagenum>

<h1>
	    page no:283
</h1>


<p>
	(c) Uniformity: In editing data sets, another keen look out should be for any lack of uniformity
in interpretation of questions and instructions by the data recorders. For instance the responses
towards a specific feeling could have been queried from a positive as well as a negative angle. While
interpreting the answers, care should be taken as to record the answer as a “positive question"
response or as “negative question” response. In all, uniformity checks for consistency in coding
throughout the questionnaire/ interview schedule response/ data set.
</p>

<p>
	The final point in the editing of data sets is to maintain a log of all corrections that have been
carried out at this stage The documentation of these corrections help the researcher to retain the original data set.
</p>

<h1>
	               10.4 CODING AND CLASSIFICATION
</h1>

<p>
	The edited data are then subject to codification and classification. Coding process assigns
numerals or other symbols to the several responses of the data set. It is therefore a pre-requisite
prepare a coding scheme for the data set. The recording of the data is done on the basis of this
coding scheme.
</p>

<p>
	The responses collected in a data sheet varies, sometimes the responses could be the choice
among a multiple response, sometimes the response could be in terms of values and sometimes the
response could be alphanumeric. At the recording stage itself, if some codification were done to the
responses collected, it would be useful 1n the data analysis. When codification IS done, it is imperative
to keep a log of the codes allotted to the observations. This code sheet will help 1n the
identification of variables/ observations and the basis for such codification.
</p>

<p>
	The first coding done to primary data sets are the individual observations themselves. this
response sheet coding gives a benefit to the research, in that, the verification and editing of recording
and further contact with respondents can be achieved without any difficulty. The codification can be
made at the time of distribution of the primary data sheets itself. The codes can be alphanumeric to
keep track of where and to whom it had been sent. For instance if the data consists of several public
at different localities, the sheets that are distributed 1n a specific locality may carry a unique  part code
which is alphabetic. To this alphabetic code a numeric code can be attached to distinguish the person
to whom the primary instrument was distributed. This also helps the researcher to keep track of who
the respondents are and who are the probable respondents from whom primary data sheets are yet to
be collected. Even at a latter stage, any specific queries on a specific response sheet can be clarified.
</p>

<p>
	The variables or observations in the primary instrument would also need codification, especially
when they are categorized. The categorization could be on a scale i.e., most preferable to not
preferable, or it could be very specific such as Gender classified as Male and Female. Certain
classifications can lead to open-ended classification such as education classification, Illiterate
, Graduate, Professional, Others, please specify. In such instances, the codification needs to be
carefully done to include all possible responses under “Others, please specify”. If the
preparation of the exhaustive list is not feasible, then it will be better to create a separate
variable for the “Others, please specify category and record all responses as such.
</p>

<p>
	Numeric coding: Coding need not necessarily be numeric. It can also be alphabetic. Coding has
to be compulsorily numeric, when the variable is to be subject to further parametric analysis.
</p>

<p>
	Alphabetic coding. A mere tabulation or frequency count or graphical representation of the
variable may be given an alphabetic coding.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000284">284</pagenum>

 <h1>
	page no:284
</h1>
<p>

  Zero coding: A coding of zero has to be assigned carefully to a variable. In many instances,
when manual analysis is done, a code of 0 would imply a “no response” from the respondents. Hence,
if a value of 0 is to be given to a specific response in the data sheet, it should not lead to the same
interpretation of "no response”. For instance, there will be a tendency to give a code of 0 to a “no"
answer. However, if the respondent had not chosen “yes” or “no”, then a different coding than 0
should be given in the data sheet. An illustration of the coding process of some of the demographic
variables is given in the following table.
</p>

   <p>
	The coding sheet needs to be prepared carefully if the data recording is not done by the
researcher, but is outsourced to a data entry ﬁrm or individual. In order to enter the data in the same
perspective as the researcher would like to view it, the data coding sheet is to be prepared first and
a copy of the data coding sheet should be given to the outsourcer to help in the data entry procedure.
Sometimes, the researcher might not be able to code the data from the primary instrument itself. He
may need to classify the responses and then code them. For this purpose, classification of data is
also necessary at the data entry stage.
</p>

<h1>
	Classification
</h1>

   <p>
	When open-ended responses have been received, classification is necessary to code the response
.For instance, the income of the responded Could be an open- ended question. From all responses, a
suitable classification can be arrived at. A classification method should meet certain
requirements or should be guided by certain rules.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000285">285</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:285
</h1>

<p>
     First, classification should be linked to the theory and the aim of the particular study. The
objectives of the study will determine the dimensions chosen for coding. The categorization should
meet the information required to test the hypotheses or investigative questions.
</p>

<p>
	   Second, the scheme of classification should be exhaustive. That IS, there must be a category for
every response. For example, the classification of martial status into three- -category viz., "named"
“single”, and “divorced” is not exhaustive, because responses like‘ ‘widower” or “separated" cannot
be fitted into the scheme. Here, an open- ended question will be the best mode of getting the response
From the responses collected, the researcher can fit a meaningful and theoretically supportive
classification. The inclusion of the classification “Others” tends to fill in the cluttered, but few responses
from the data sheets. But “others” categorization has to carefully used by the researcher. However
the “other” categorization tends to defeat the very purpose of classification, which is designed to
distinguish between observations in terms of the properties under study.1 The classification "others"
will be very useful when a minority of respondents in the data set give varying answers. For instance,
the reading habits of newspapers may be surveyed. The 95 respondents out of 100 could be easily
classified into 5 large reading groups while the 5 respondents could have given a unique answer
These given answers rather than being separately considered could be clubbed under the "others"
heading for meaningful interpretation of respondents’ reading habits.
</p>

<p>
	Third, the categories must also be mutually exhaustive, so that each caSe is clasSified only once
This requirement is violated when some of the categories overlap or different dimensions are mixed up.
</p>

 <p>
	 The number of categorization for a specific question/ observation at the coding stage should be
maximum permissible. Since, reducing the categorization at the analysis level would be easier than
splitting an already classified group of responses. However, the number of categories is limited by
the number of cases and the anticipated statistical analysis that are to be used on the observation.
</p>

<h1>
	               10.5 TRANSCRIPTIONS OF DATA
</h1>

 <p>
	 When the observations collected by the researcher are not very large, the simple inferences that
can be drawn from the observations can be transferred to a data sheet, which is a summary of all
responses on all observations from a research inStrument. The main aim of transition is to minimize
the shuffling process between several responses and several observations. Suppose a research
instrument Contains 120 responses and the observations has been collected from 200 respondents, to prepare
a simple summary of one response from all 200 observations would require a shuffling of 200 pages
The process is quite tedious if several summary tables are to be prepared from the instrument. The
transcription process helps in the presentation of all responses and observations on data sheets, which
can help the researcher to arrive at preliminary conclusions as to the nature of the sample collected
etc. Transcription is hence an intermediary process between data coding and data tabulation.
</p>


<h1>
	Methods of Transcription
</h1>

<p>
	 The researcher may adopt a manual or computerized transcription. Long work sheets, sorting
cards or sorting strips could be used by the researcher to manually transcript the responses. The
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000286">286</pagenum>

 <h1>
	   page no:286
</h1>

<p>
	Computerized transcription could be done using a data base package such as spreadsheets, text files or other databases.
</p>

   <p>
   	The main requisite for a transcription process is the preparation of the data sheets where
observations are the rows of the database and the responses/ variables are the columns of the data
sheet. Each variable should be given a label so that long questions can be covered under the label
names. The label names are thus the links to specific questions in the reSearch instrument. For
instance, opinion on consumer satisfaction could be identified through a number of statements (say
(10). The data sheet does not contain the details of the statement, but gives a link to the question in
the research instrument through variable labels. In this instance the variable names could be given as
CS1, CS2, C83, CS4, CS5, CS6, CS7, CS8, CS9 and CS10. The label CS indicating Consumer
Satisfaction and the number 1 to 10 indicates the statements measuring consumer satisfaction. Once
the labelling process has been gone through for all the responses in the research instrument, the
transcription of the responses is done.
</p>

<h1>
	Manual Transcription
</h1>

<p>
    When the sample size is manageable, the researcher need not use any computerization process
to analyze the data. The researcher could prefer a manual transcription and analysis of responses. The
choices of manual transcription would be when the number of responses in a research instrument is
vary less, say 10 responses, and the number of observations collected are within 100. A transcription
sheet with 100 x 50 (assuming each response has 5 options) row /column can be easily managed by
her manually. If, on the other hand the variables in the research instrument are more than
40 each variable has 5 options, it leads to a worksheet of 100 x 200 size which might not be easily
managed by the researcher manually. In the second instance if the number of responses are less than
30, then the manual worksheet could be attempted manually. In all other instances, it is advisable to use a computerized transcription process.
</p>

<h1>
	Long Worksheets
</h1>
<p>

   Long Worksheets? require quality paper, preferably chart sheets, thick enough to last several
usage. The worksheets normally are ruled both horizontally and vertically, allowing a response to
be written in the boxes. "If one sheet is not sufficient, the researcher may use multiple ruled sheets
to accommodate all the observations. Headings of responses which are variable names, and their
coding (options) are filled in the first two rows. The first column Contains the code of observations.
for each  variable, now the responses from the research instrument are then transferred to the worksheet
by ticking the specific option that the observer has chosen. If the variable cannot be coded into
categories, requisite length for recording the actual response of the observer should be provided for in the worksheet.
</p>

   <p>
	 The Worksheet can then be used for preparing the Summary tables or can be subject to further
analysis of data. The original research instruments can be now kept aside as safe documents. Copies
of the data sheets can also be kept for future references. As has been discussed under the editing
section, the transcript data has to be subject to a testing to ensure error free transcription of data.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000287">287</pagenum>

 <h1>
	page no:287
</h1>

   <p>
	  Transcription can be made as and when edited instruments are ready for processing. Once all
schedules/ questionnaires have been transcribed, the frequency tables can be constructed straight
from the worksheet.

   Other methods of manual transcription include adoption of sorting strips or cards.

  In olden days data entry and processing were made through mechanical and semi auto-matic
devices such as key punch using punch cards. The arrival Of computers has changed the data
processing methodology altogether.
</p>

<h1>
	10. 6 PRELIMINARIES FOR COMPUTERIZED DATA PROCESSING
</h1>

    <p>
	When the sample size is large and/or when the variables studied is vast and interrelated, data
can be transcribed to the computer for further easy processing. Many data base software packages are
available using which data can be easily transcribed. The database software shows a worksheet similar
to the manual worksheet prepared above. Some important points that can be kept in mind while
preparing the ‘coding’ for computerized data entry are:
</p>

<p>
	(a) Use a ‘natural’ coding scheme. Logical ordering of responses would be preferable. For
instance, when the response is “very high” “more than once”, “only once nil”, the coding
could be in the integer format of “4”, “3”, “2”, “1”. The alphabetical coding could also be
used such as “H”, “F”, “O”, “N”. The use of numbers would help in further netric
evaluations of that variable, while the alphanumeric codes would be amenable only for categorical
analysis. If they are to be used as a metric measure, recoding of these variables into
numeric format should be carried out using the software packages.
</p>


<p>
	(b) Avoid the use of blank space as a coding category: Many computer software programs may
 not distinguish between blank space and zero unless otherwise specifically marked. Some-
times blank space may also be inferred as “no response”/ “no information” by the software
packages. When using alphanumeric coding also the use of blank space would differentiate
it as an altogether separate response. Thus, in an alphanumeric coding the entry “KBALA"
will be different from entry “KBALA”. The blank space between A and B makes it a
unique response through the researcher might have erroneously used it.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000288">288</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:288
</h1>

<p>
	(c) Do not use the "-"  “+ ” symbols: These would be taken as a numeric expression indicating
negative and positive integers. Hence, avoidance of these symbols as a code is recommended.
</p>

<h1>
	           10.7 TABULATION
</h1>

   <p>
	The transcription of data can be used to summarize and arrange the data in a compact form for
further analysis. The process is called tabulation. Thus, tabulation is a process of summarizing raw
data and displaying them on compact statistical tables for further analysis. It involves counting the
number of cases falling into each of the categories identified by the researcher.
</p>

    <p>
	Tabulation can be done manually or through the computer. The choice depends upon the size
and type of study, cost considerations, time pressures and the availability of software packages.
Manual tabulation is suitable for small and simple studies.
</p>

<h1>
	Manual Tabulation
</h1>

   <p>
	When data are transcribed in a classified form as per the planned scheme of classification,
category -wise totals can be extracted from the respective columns of the work sheets. A simple
frequency table counting the number of “Yes” and “No” responses can be made by easily counting
the "y" response column and “N” response column in the manual worksheet table prepared earlier.

This is a one -way frequency table and they are readily inferred from the totals of each column in the
worksheet. Sometimes, the researcher has to cross tabulate two variables for instance the age group
of vehicle owners. This requires a two- -way classification and cannot be inferred straight from the
worksheet. For this purpose, tally sheets are used. This process of tabulation is simple and does not
require any technical knowledge or skill. If one wants to prepare a table showing the distribution of
respondents by age, a tally sheet showing the age groups horizontally is prepared. Tally marks are
then made for the respective group i.e., ‘vehicle owners’, from each line of response in the worksheet.

After every four tally, the fifth tally is cut across the previous four tallies. This represents a group
of five items. This arrangement facilitates easy counting of each one of the class groups.
Illustration of this tally sheet is presented below.
</p>

  <p>
	Although manual tabulation is simple and easy to construct, it can be tedious, slow and error-
prone as responses increase.
</p>

<p>
	    Computerized tabulation is easy with the help of software packages. The input requirement will
be the column and row variables. The software package then computes the number of records in each
cell of the row/column categories The most popular package is the Statistical Package for Social
sciences (SPSS). It is an integrated set of programs suitable for analysis of social science data. This package contains programs for a wide range of operations and analysis such as handling missing data,
according, variable information, simple descriptive analysis, cross tabulation, multivariate
analysis and non-parametric analysis.

<h1>
	   10.8 CONSTRUCTION OF FREQUENCY TABLE, page no:289
</h1>

 <p>
	 Frequency tables provide a “shorthand” summary of data. The importance of presenting
statistical data in tabular form needs no emphasis. Tables facilitate comprehending masses of data at a
glance; they conserve space and reduce explanations and descriptions to a minimum. They give a
visual picture of relationships between variables and categories. They facilitate summation of items
and the detection of errors and omissions and they provide a basis for computations.
</p>

<p>
   It is important to make a distinction between the general-purpose tables and specific tables. The
general- purpose tables are primary or reference tables designed to include large amounts of source
data in convenient and accessible form. The special purpose tables are analytical or derivate ones that
demonstrate significant relationships in the data‘ or the results of statistical analysis. Tables in
of government on population, vital statistics, agriculture, industries etc., are of general- purpose type.
They represent extensive repositories of statistical information. Special purpose tables are found in
monographs, research reports and articles and are used as instruments of analysis. In research, we
are primarily concerned with special purpose tables.
</p>

<p>
	Components of a table: The major components of a table are:
A. Heading

(i) Table Number
(ii) Title of the Table
(iii) Designation of units

B. Body

(i) Stub-head: Heading of all rows or blocks of stub items
(ii) Body head: Headings of all columns or main captions and their sub-captions
(iii) Field/body: The cells in rows and columns

C. Notations

(i) Footnotes, wherever applicable
(ii) Source, wherever applicable

<h1>
	Principles of Table Construction, page no:290
</h1>

<p>
	 There are certain generally accepted principles of rules relating to construction of tables. They
are:

(a) Every table should have a title. The title should represent a succinct description of the
contents of the table. It should be clear and concise. It should be placed above the body of
the table.

(b) A number to facilitate easy reference should identify every table. The number can be
centred above the title. The table numbers should run in a consecutive serial order. Alter-
 natively tables in Chapter 1 be numbered as 1.1, 1.2, 1., in Chapter 2 as 2.1, 2.2, 2.3....
and so on.

(c) The captions (or column headings) should be clear and brief.

(d) The units of measurement under each heading must always be indicated.

(e) Any explanatory footnotes concerning the table itself are placed directly beneath the table
and in order to obviate any possible Confusion with the textual footnotes such reference
symbols as the asterisk (*) dagger (+) and the like may be used.

(f) If the data in a series of tables have been obtained from different sources, it is ordinarily
advisable to indicate the specific sources in a place just below the table.

(g) Usually lines separate columns from one another. Lines are always drawn at the top and
bottom of the table and below the captions.

(h) The columns may be numbered to facilitate reference

(i) All column figures should be properly aligned. Decimal points and ‘plus’ or ‘minus’ signs ‘
should be in perfect alignment.

(j) Columns and rows that are to be compared with one another should be brought close
   together.

(k) Totals of rows should be placed at the extreme right column and totals of columns at the
 bottom.

(l) In order to emphasize the relative significance of certain categories, different kinds of type
,spacing and identifications can be used.

(m) The arrangement of the categories in a table may be chronological, geographical, alphabeti-cal or according to magnitude. Numerical categOries are usually arranged in descending
order of magnitude.

(n) Miscellaneous and exceptional items are generally placed in the last row of the table.

(o) Usually the larger number of items is listed vertically. This means that a table’s length is
more than its width.

(p) Abbreviations should be avoided whenever possible and ditto marks should not be used in
a table.

(q) The table should be made as logical, clear, accurate. and simple as possible.

  Text references should identify tables by number, rather than by such expressions as “the table
above" or “the following table”; Tables should not exceed the page size by photo stating. Tables that

,depending on the nature of the data and the number of cases being studied. After 11.

<p>
	are too wide for the page may be turned sidewise, with the top facing the left margin or building of
the script. Where should tables be placed in a research report or thesis? Some writers places both
special purpose and general-purpose tables in an appendix and refer to them in the text by numbers
. This practice has the disadvantage of inconveniencing the reader who wants to study the tabulated
data as the text is read. A more appropriate procedure is to place special purpose tables in the
text and primary tables, if needed at all, in an appendix.
</p>

<h1>
	Frequency Distribution and Class Intervals
</h1>

<p>

    Variables that are classified according to magnitude or size are often arranged in the form of
a frequency table. In constructing this table it is necessary to determine the number of class
intervals to be used and the size of the class intervals.
</p>

<p>
   A distinction is usually made between continuous and discrete variables. A continuous variable
has an unlimited number of possible values between the lowest and highest with no gaps or breaks
Examples of continuous variables are age, weight, temperature etc. A Discrete variable can have
series of specified values with no possibility of values between these points. Each value of a discrete
variable is distinct and separate. Examples of discrete variables are gender of persons (male/
female) occupation (salaried, business, profession), Car Size (800cc 1000cc 1200cc).
</p>

 <p>
	In practice, all variables are treated as discrete units, the continuous variables being stated
some discrete unit size according to the needs of a particular situation. For example, length is
described in discrete units of millimeters or a tenth of an inch.
</p>

 <p>
	   Class intervals: Ordinarily, the number of class intervals may not be less than 5 nor more
than highest and lowest values and the features of the data, the number of intervals can be easily
determined.
</p>

<p>
	    For many types of data, it is desirable to have class intervals of uniform size. The intervals
should neither be too small nor too large. Whenever possible, the intervals should represent common
and convenient numerical divisions such as 5 or 10, rather than odd division such as 3 or 7

   Class intervals must be clearly designated in a frequency table in such a way as to obviate
possibility of misinterpretation or confusion. For example, to present the age group of a population,
the use of intervals of 1- 20, 20- 50, and 50 and above would be confusing. This may be present as
1-20, 21—50, and above 50.
</p>

<p>
	   Every class interval has a midpoint. For example, the midpoint of an interval 1-20 is 10.5 and
the midpoint of class interval 1-25 would be 13 Once class intervals are determined, it is routine work to count the number of cases that fall in each interval.
</p>

 <p>
	   One-way tables: One-way frequency tables present the distribution of cases on only a single
dimension or variable. For example, the distribution of respondents of gender, by religion, socio-
economic status and the like are shown in one-way tables. Table 10.1 illustrates one-way tables. one
way tables are rarely used, since the result of frequency distributions can be described in simple
sentences. For instance, the gender distribution of a sample study may be described as: “The
sample data is represented 58% by males and 42% of the sample are females.”
</p>

<h1>
	  page no:292
</h1>

<p>
	   Two-way tables: Distributions in terms of two or more variables and the relationship between
two variables are shown in two- -way tables. The categories of one variable are presented one below
another, on the left margin of the table and those of another variable at the upper part of the
table,
one by the side of another. The cells represent particular combinations of both variables. To
compare
the distribution of cases, raw numbers are converted into percentages based on the number of cases
in each category. Table 10.2 and Table 10.3 illustrate two-way tables.
</p>

<p>
	  Another method of constructing a two-way table is to state the percent of representation as a
within brackets item rather than as a separate column. Here, special care has to be taken as to how
percentages are calculated, either on a horizontal representation of data or as a vertical
representations of data. Sometimes, the table heading itself provides a meaning as to the
method of representation in the two— way table.

	 10.9 GRAPHS/CHARTS/DIAGRAMS
</h1>

<p>
	In presenting the data of frequency distributions and statistical computations, it is often describe
to use appropriate forms of graphic presentation. In addition to tabular forms, graphic presentation
involves use of graphics, charts and other pictorial devices such as diagrams. These forms and devices
reduce large masses of statistical data to a form that can be quickly understood at a glance. The
meaning of figures in tabular form may be difficult for the mind to grasp or retain. “Properly
constructed graphs and charts relieve the mind of burdensome details by portraying facts concisely
,logically and simply. ”9 They, by emphasizing new and significant relationships, are also useful
in discovering new facts and in developing hypotheses.
</p>

<p>
	   The device of graphic presentation is particularly useful when the prospective readers are non-
technical people or general public. It is useful to even technical people for dramatizing certain points
about data for important points can be more effectively captured in pictures than in tables. However,
graphic forms are not substitutes for tables, but are additional tools for the researcher to
emphasize the research findings.
</p>

<p>
	    Graphic presentation must be planned with utmost care and diligence. Graphic forms used
should be simple, clear and accurate and also be appropriate to the data. In planning this work,
the following questions must be considered.

     What is the purpose of the diagram?

    What facts are to be emphasized?

    What is the educational level of the audience?

   How much time is available for the preparation? of the diagram?

   What kind of chart will portray the data most clearly and accurately?
</p>

<h1>
	Types and General Rules
</h1>

<p>
	The most commonly used graphic forms may be grouped into the following categories:
(a) Line Graphs or Charts

(b) Bar Charts

(c) Segmental Presentations

(d) Scatter Plots

(e) Bubble Charts

(f) Stock Plots

(g) Pictographs

(h) Chesnokov Faces

The general rules to be followed in graphic representations are:

(a) The chart should have a title placed directly above the chart.

(b) The title should be clear, concise and simple and should describe the nature of the data
presented.

(c) Numerical data upon Which the chart is based should be presented in an accompanying
table.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000294">294</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:294
</h1>

 <p>
(d) The horizontal line measures time or independent variable and the vertical line the measured
     variable.

(e) Measurements proceed from left to right on the horizontal line and from bottom to top on
    the vertical.

(f) Each curve or bar on the chart should be labelled.

(g) If there are more than one curve or bar, they should be clearly differentiated from one
    another by distinct patterns or colours.

(h) The zero point should always be represented and the scale intervals should be equal.

(i) Graphic forms should be used sparingly. Too many forms detract from rather than illuminate
   the presentation.

(j) Graphic forms should follow not precede the related textual discussion.
</p>

<h1>
	Line Graphs
</h1>

  <p>
	 The line graph is useful for showing changes in data relationships over a period of time. In this
graph, figures are plotted in relation to two intersecting lines or axes. The horizontal line is called
the abscissa or X- axis and the vertical, the ordinal or Y- -axis. The point at which the two axes intersect
is zero for both X and Y- -axis. The ‘O’ is the origin of coordinates. The two lines divide the region
of the plane into four sections known as quadrants that are numbered anti clockwise. Measurements
to the right and above ‘0’ are positive (plus) and measurements to the left and below ‘0 are negative
(minus). Exhibit 10.1 is an illustration of the features of a rectangular coordinate type of graph
. Any
point in the plane of the two axes is plotted in terms of the two axes reading from the origin ‘0’
.Scale intervals in both the axes should be equal. If a part of the scale is omitted, a set of parallel.
judged lines should be used to indicate the break in the scale. The time dimension or independent
variable is represented by the X —axis and the other variable by Y-axis.
</p>

<p>
	 A sample line chart is provided in Exhibit 10. 2. Each variable can be given a separate colour
coding or style differentiation. A think, thick, or broken lines could distinguish the variables in terms of their line style.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000295">295</pagenum>

 <h1>
	page no:295
</h1>

 <p>

   The line graph can also provide markers for each data point. The marker for each variable can
be different to distinguish it from other variables. Exhibit 10.3 gives an illustration of a line graph
with markers to distinguish between the variables. The markers also highlight the value at any specific
point. It distinctly points out the values that have been joined together to form the line graph. The
horizontal lines drawn across the body of the line graph is called the grid lines. The grid
lines help in identifying the scale differences across the graph at a glance.
</p>

<h1>
	Histogram
</h1>

  <p>
	 This is another form of line chart used for presenting a frequency distribution. It is constructed
by erecting vertical lines on the limits of the class intervals marked on the base line. The vertical lines.
</p>

<p>
	so drawn form a series of contiguous rectangles or columns. The width of each rectangle represents
its class interval and the height represents the class frequency. Exhibit 10.4 illustrates the
histogram.
</p>

<h1>
	Frequency polygon
</h1>

  <p>
	 It is often more convenient to draw a frequency polygon instead of drawing a histogram of a
distribution. In laying out a frequency polygon, the frequency of each class is located at the midpoint
of the interval and straight lines then connect the plotted points. If two or more series are shown on
the same graph. the curves can be made with different kinds of ruling. If the total nUmber of cases

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000297">297</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 page no:297
</h1>

<p>
	 in the two series is of different size, the frequencies are often reduced to percentages. The frequency
polygon is particularly appropriate for portraying continuous series. Exhibit 10.5 illustrates a
frequency polygon.
</p>

<p>
	    It is sometimes desirable to portray the data by a smoothed curve. The chart is then called a
frequency curve. Frequency polygon gives an instant picture of a frequency distribution and shows
whether the distribution is normal or otherwise. For example, if the peak of the frequencies occurs
in the middle, the distribution is relatively a normal one. If the peak occurs towards one end or
the other, then the distribution is skewed.
</p>

<h1>
	Ogive
</h1>

<p>
	   The ogive is a line chart plotted on arithmetic graph paper from a cumulative frequency
distribution that may be cumulated downward or upward.

    It is useful in representing population, per capita income, per capita] earnings etc. Converting
the data of the distributions to percentages of the total then cumulating the percentages and plotting
the ogives on the same grid may give a useful comparison of two or more distributions. The
differences in steepness and share of the ogives facilitate comparative observations. Exhibit 10.6
illustrate the ogive.
</p>


<h1>
	Lorenz Curve
</h1>

<p>
	    The Lorenz curve is a line chart used to compare the proportionality in two quantitative
variables. It is commonly used to show the degree by which the distribution of income per family departs
from the distribution of the number of families; it shows that a disparate proportion of the income
goes to a few families.

   The curve is plotted from cumulative percentages of the total of each of the variables. Exhibit
10.7 is an illustration of the Lorenz curve. The independent variable viz., the cumulative percentages
of total number of employees is marked along the base line, and the cumulative percentages of total
income (i. e., dependent variable) are plotted on the vertical line. The “line of equal "distribution" is
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000298">298</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no: 298
</h1>

<p>
	a line that would have been obtained if the two distributions had been proportional. The line designated
‘actual distribution’ reveals that the distribUtion of income is unequal compared to the distribution
 of the number of employees. The more the ‘actual distribution’ line departs from the ‘line of
equal distribution’, the more unequal is the Y-variable in terms of the X—variable and the more
disproportionate is the relationship.
</p>


<h1>
	Bar Charts
</h1>

 <p>
	 These charts consist of either vertiCal or horizontal bars to represent variables. The length of the
bars varies corresponding to the values of the variable Bar charts are the most effective pictorial
device for comparing data. The bars may be depicted in solid blocks or in patterns of dots, dashes
etc. they may be of different forms: (1) linear or one- -dimensional, (2) a real or two- dimensional, and
(3) cubic or three dimensional. The actual numerical values may be shown on the X—axis or Y—axis,
case may be, or at the immediate ends of the bars.
</p>

<p>
	Vertical Bar Charts consists of vertical bars or columns erected on the horizontal line and the
values of the bars are shown on the Y- axis. Exhibit 10.8 .illuStrates a typical. vertical bar
chart.
</p>

 <p>
	The vertical bar charts are commonly used for presenting time series data.

  Horizontal Bar Charts are commonly used for presenting qualitative and geographical distributions
.They are also used for discrete quantitative distributions. Exhibit 10.9 is an illustration of
horizontal bar chart.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000299">299</pagenum>

<h1>
	 Component Bar Chart, page no:299
</h1>

 <p>
	 This is employed to show comparisons involving two or more variables on a single chart (see
Exhibit 10.10). This may consist of either horizontal bars or vertical bars. This type of chart
shows not only variations in total values, but also components of the respective totals.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000300">300</pagenum>


<h1>
	principles of Designing Bar Charts ,page no:300
</h1>

<p>
	In constructing bar charts the following principles should be adopted:

1. The bars should be arranged in some systematic order: in chronological order in a presentation
of time series; according to magnitude, starting with the largest, in other cases.

2. The bars should be of uniform width and properly adapted to the over-all size, proportion,
and other features of the chart.

3. A scale should be included in every bar chart. The number of intervals on the scale should
be adequate for measuring distances but not too numerous to cause confusion. The intervals
should be indicated in round numbers.

 4. The status or designations for the various categories of a bar chart should be clearly
 indicated to the left of the vertical base line.
</p>

<h1>
	Pie or Circle Charis
</h1>

 <p>
	 The circle or pie chart is a component parts bar chart. The component parts form the segments
circle. (See Exhibit 10.11). The circle chart is usually a percentage chart. The data are converted
to percentage of the total; and the proportional segments, therefore, give a clear picture of the
relationship among the component parts.
</p>

 <p>
	 The name of each segment and its percentage are placed inside its own area. When a segment
is too small, an arrow is drawn to it and the legend is placed outside, in a horizontal position. The
pie hart is commonly used for presenting the sectoral distribution of national income, the cost
structure of a firm, or any other type of simple percentage distribution.
</p>

<h1>
	Pictograms
</h1>

<p>
  A pictogram is a variation of the bar chart. In it the values are represented by identical symbol
or pictures. Each one represents a fixed size of the variable. The symbols used may be appropriate
to the type of data. For example, pictures of human beings can be used for depicting population
data.
</p>

  <h1>
	  page no:302
</h1>

(See Exhibit 10.12). The pictogram is used for qualitative distributions and for time series distributions as well.

   The following rules should be observed in developing a pictorial chart:
<p>

1. The symbols should be self- explanatory.

2. Each symbol should represent a convenient sum of units.

3. The chart should be made as simple and clear as possible.

4.The chart should give only an over-all picture; it should not show minute details.

5. Comparison in terms of one dimension only should be charted.
</p>

<h1>
	Conclusion
</h1>

<p>
	    Whatever the graphic devices we use to represent our data, we must draw them accurately;
otherwise, we may allow the readers to infer unintended meanings.

    For comparing two or more items, the bar chart is ideal. The chart should be designed so that
only linear comparisons are made. With linear comparison, the eye is not deceived with two or
three dimensions, accurate comparisons are more difficult.

<h1>
	 11.1 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, page no: 304
</h1>

<p>
	  The analysis of data is the most skilled task in the research process. It calls for the researcher’ s
own judgement and skill. Analysis means a critical examination of the assembled and grouped data
for Studying the characteristics of the object under study and for determining the patterns of relationships
among the variables relating to it. Both quantitative and non- quantitative methods are used. However,
social research most often requires quantitative analysis involving the application of various
statistical techniques.
</p>


<h1>
	Purpose of Statistical Analysis
</h1>

<p>
   Statistical analysis of data serves several major purposes. First, it summarizes large mass of data
into understandable and meaningful form. This is the role of descriptive statistics. The reduction of data facilitates further analysis.
</p>

<p>
	   Second, statistics makes exact descriptions possible. For example, when we say that the educational
level of people 1n a district 1s very high, the description is not specific; but when statistical measures
like the percentages of literate amOng males and females, the percentages of degree holders among
makes and females are available, the description becomes exact.
</p>

<p>
	   Third, statistical analysis facilitates identification of the causal factors underlying complex
phenomena What are the factors that determine a variable like labour productivity or academic
performance of students? What are the relative contributions of the causative factors? Answers to
such questions can be obtained from statistical multivariate analysis.
</p>

<p>
	  Fourth statistical analysis aids the drawing of reliable inferences from observational data. Data
are collected and analyzed 1n order to predict or make inferences about situations that have not been
measured in full. What would be the growth rate of industrial production during the coming year?
</p>













<pagenum page="normal" id="page000305">305</pagenum>

<h1>
	 page no:305
</h1>

<p>
	What would be the probable demand for a particular product in the coming year? Questions of this
kind require predictions of future states to be made on the basis of current knowledge. Such predictions
are essential in any strategic decision relating to management of an enterprise or the national
economy or a social action program. The statistical prediction is one of the functions of inferential statistics.
</p>

  <p>
	  Fifth, statistical analysis also helps making estimations or generalizations from the results of
sample surveys. This is another function of inferential statistics. Sample statistics based on probability
samples may give good estimates of particular population parameters. Any estimate will deviate from
the true value due to sampling error. The process of statistical inference enables us to evaluate
the accuracy of the estimates.
</p>

 Last (inferential) statistical analysis is useful for assessing the significance of specific sample
results under assumed population conditions. This type of analysis is called hypothesis testing.

<h1>
	Approach to Statistical Analysis
</h1>

<p>
	 The general approach to statistical analysis consists of several different aspects:

    The first aspect is what is called descriptive analysis. This involves construction of statistical
distributions and calculation of simple measures like averages, percentages and measures of
dispersion for describing the features of the research queries.
</p>

<p>
	  It is common to begin the analysis by showing the distribution of respondents by each of the
pertinent variables. For example, if the respondents are persons, their distribution by gender, age,
social class, income level etc., are worked out. If the respondents are institutions, their distributions
by form, size, age, type, efficiency etc., are shown. Then some average value that represents the
distribution is computed by using the appropriate measure of central tendency — the mode, the
median or the arithmetic mean.
</p>

<p>
	   The second aspect of analysis is to compare two or more distributions or two or more sub-
groups within a distribution. Any comparison by measures of central tendency only would be misleading
for they do not give a complete indication of the nature of distributions. Hence measures of dispersion
are also used. The latter indicate the pattern of the spread of individual values. The measures of
dispersion include the range, the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation. These measures
are used to compare the relative wideness of spread in any two or more frequency distributions. (see Section 11.3, below).
</p>

<p>
	  Other methods like ratios, proportions and percentages are also used for comparing distributions
or sub-groups. Ratios show the relation between one figure and another. They can also be expressed
as proportions and percentages. These are relative measures and permit the comparison of groups of
unequal size, e.g., liquidity and turnover ratios and return on investment are used for inter-
firm and intra- firm comparisons.
</p>

<p>
	   The purpose of using percentages (and ratios and proportions) is to simplify the problem of
comparison. It is important to note what their use implies. First, they serve to put qualitative
characteristics into numerical form. For example, the performance of two similar firms may be
compared in terms of their rates of return on investment. Second, percentages reduce two frequency
distributions to a common base, thus making comparisons much simple. However, this obscures
absolute comparisons that are sometimes more important.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000306">306</pagenum>

 <h1>
	   page no:306
</h1>

<p>
	The third aspect of analysis is to study the nature of relationships among variables. The coefficients
of correlation, partial and multiple correlation and regression are used for this analysis. In order to
Know the effect of one or more independent variables on the dependent variable, regression
analysis is made. Once this relationship is established it is used for prediction purposes.
</p>

<p>
	 In survey research, it is not always possible to study all the units in the population for drawing
generalizations about it. Hence, a representative sample is drawn and the population characteristics
are estimated from the results of the sample survey. But the results of a sample may have some errors.
Hence, the validity of inferences drawn from sample survey results has to be tested. Parametric tests
of significance such as "t test, ‘F’ test etc., and non-parametric tests like chi- -square test, K S test,
sign test etc., are used for this purpose. These tests are also used for testing the hypothesis
relating to variables.
</p>

<p>
	Another aspect of analysis is to find out the factors that explain the relationship between a
set of variables. Factor analysis is used for this purpose.
</p>

<h1>
	Types of Statistical Analysis
</h1>

<p>
	Statistical analysis 18 used for estimating the values of unknown characteristics (parameters) of
the population and for testing hypothesis for drawing inferences. Analysis may therefore be
broadly classified into (1) descriptive analysis and (2) inferential analysis.
</p>

<h1>
	Descriptive Analysis
</h1>

 <p>
	This type of analysis describes the nature of an object or phenomenon under study. This analysis
provides us with profiles of organizations, work groups, persons and other subjects on any of a
multitude of characteristics such as size, compositions, efficiency, preferences etc.

  This sort of analysis may describe data on one variable, two variables or more than two variables.
Accordingly it is called univariate analysis, bivariate analysis and multivariate analysis
respectively.

  Multivariate analysis consists of (a) multiple regression analysis, ([9) multiple discriminant analysis,
(c) cannonical analysis, (d) multivariate analysis of variance and (e) factor analysis

(a) Multiple Regression Analysis is made when one dependent variable is presumed to be a
function of two or more independent variables.

(b) Multiple Discriminant Analysis is appropriate when the dependent variable cannot be
measured but can be identified with a particular group on the basis of several predictor
variables.

(c) Cannonical Analysis is used for simultaneously predicting a set of dependent variables
from their joint covariance with a set of independent variables.

(d) In Multivariate Analysis of Variance, the ratio of ‘among group variance’ to ‘within
group variance’ is worked on a set of variables. This is useful for testing hypothesis concerning
multivariate differences among group responses to experimental manipulations.

(e) Factor Analysis IS useful for grouping a large number of variables into a few independent
factor dimensions.
</p>

<h1>
	Inferential Analysis
</h1>

 <p>
Inferential analysis is cOncerned with drawing inferences and conclusions from. the findings of
a research study. There are two areas of statistical inference, viz., (a) statistical estimation
and (b) the testing of hypothesis.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000307">307</pagenum>

<h1>
	 page no:307
</h1>

<p>
	 (a) Statistical estimation involves estimation of the population parameters from the results of
sample data analysis. In order to arrive at accurate estimates of parameters, the researcher
has to effectively deal with three problems: (i) the precise definition of population, (ii) the
determination of adequate sample size, and (iii) the selection of a representative sample.
</p>

<p>
	(b) Testing Hypothesis: Hypotheses are tested with tests of significance. This testing involves
the assessment of the probability of specific sampling results under assumed assumed population
conditions. Assumptions about the population parameters are made in advance and the
sample then provides the test of these assumptions. An inference is also drawn about the
relationships among variables.
</p>

<p>
	   Inferential analysis enables us to make decisions and draw conclusions from studies which could
otherwise not be feasible because of the size of the universe or of prohibitive costs of a census
survey or of destructive testing procedures as in quality control.
</p>

<p>
	   Inferential analysis involves an estimate of the accuracy of the inference called reliability. The
reliability iS expressed in terms of probability determined from the relevant statistical
distribution i.e., confidence levels.
</p>

<h1>
	Types of Statistical Measures
</h1>

<p>
	The statistical measures used in statistical analysis may be categorised into:

(a) Measures of central tendency — mean, median, mode,

(b) Measures of dispersion — ranges, deviation, standard deviation,

(c) Measures of association/ relations — correlation, regression, chi- square test, factor analysis discriminant analysis, cluster analysis, cannonical analysis

(d) Analysis of variance —— one- way ANOVA, two- -way ANOVA, MANOVA and analysis of
   covariance and

(e) Time series analysis — seasonal, cyclical, trend and erratic variations.
Each of these measures is discussed in detail in the following sections.
</p>

<h1>
	Computerized Analysis
</h1>
<p>

    Computer software packages are available for applications of various statistical techniques like
correlation coefficients, regression, multivariate analysis and the like. They facilitate complex analysis
with great ease and tremendous speed. It is not always necessary for researchers to know computer
languages or to write programs. They just have to learn how to use the appropriate programs as per
the instructions contained in them.
</p>

<p>
	  Computers can be used for generating formal models of social systems for simulating the
behaviour of persons, groups of nations and for retrieving large amounts of documentary materials
such as abstracts of journal articles.
</p>

<p>
	 The availability of computers has shifted the emphasis in social sciences from the study of
univariate and bivariate problems to the study of multivariate problems. To be efficient predictors,
social science theories generally need to be stated in multivariate terms. Before computer utilities,
multivariate techniques were so tedious that they were not commonly used. The computers have now
made these techniques accessible and practical and the potential uses of computers for research
analysis stagger the imagination.

   11.2 MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY, page no:308
</h1>

<h1>
	Introduction
</h1>

 <p>
	  A useful way to describe a set of observations is to find a single value that represents the
average’ characteristic of its frequency distribution. Such a value is known as a measure of central
tendency since it is generally located toward the centre of the distribution. The three most commonly
used measures of central tendency are the mode, the median and the arithmetic mean. Each of these
measures is a descriptive measure of central location and provides a way of reducing a large mass
of data to a single representative value.
</p>

<h1>
    Need
</h1>

     The measures of central tendency are necessary for two reasons:

1. The average represents all the measurements made on a group and gives a concise description
   of the group as a whole.

2. When two or more groups are measured, the central tendency provides the basis of comparison
   between them.

<h1>
	Made
</h1>

 <p>
	 The mode is the simplest of all averages. It is a measure that occurs most frequently in a
distribution. Consider the distribution of discipline categories of applicants in Table 11.1.
</p>


 <p>
	 The engineering category is the most predominant. This is the mode of the distribution. Note
the mode is not 210, which is the frequency of the modal category. The mode need not be
expressed numerically. It can refer to a qualitative variable as in Table 11.1.
</p>

<p>
	Grouped data: The procedure for finding the mode of a set of grouped data is described below:

    Find the category or the class interval which has the greatest frequency

     The midpoint on this category is the mode.

    For example, in Table 11.2, we find that the modal frequency is 54, which is associated with
the modal class interval of 41—60. The midpoint of this class interval is 50.5. Hence, the mode of this distribution is 50.5.
</p>

 <p>
	Most distributions are unimodal, i.e., they contain only one mode, but some distributions are
bimodal. For example, the distribution of heights of adults consisting of both men and women can
be bimodal, because each gender class has a typical height.
</p>

 <h1>
	   page no:309
</h1>

Use: The mode is an especially useful measure for qualitative data. It is the only appropriate
measure of central tendency for nominal level of data. Example of application of mode can be in
distributions like ethnic classification of occupational classification. For finding out the
typical category, the mode is the appropriate measure.

   Evaluation: The mode is easily calculable, but it is quite unstable, because its position shifts
when categorization is altered. It is a positional average and is not affected by extreme items.
It is a dead-end statistic as it is not amenable for any further arithmetic manipulation.

<h1>
	Median
</h1>

  <p>
	 The median is a positional average that divides a distribution into two equal parts so that one
half of items fall above it and the other half below it. For example, in the series 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, median is 7.
</p>
<p>

   If the number of cases (11) is odd, the median is the middle item. If n is even, the median is the
midpoint of the distance between the two middle most items, 6. g., in the distribution 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, median is midpoint between 4 and 6 i.e., 5.
</p>

<p>
	   Grouped Data: The same logic governs the computation of the median for grouped data. The
number of cases (11) in Table 11.2 is 150. Hence, the median is that point which has (n/2 = 75)75
cases above it and an equal number below it. From the cumulative frequency column, it can be seen
that 75th case falls in the class interval of 41- 60. The median can be computed by applying the
following formula:
</p>

<p>

    Where “I is the lower limit of the median category, "cf is the cumulative frequency up to but
not including the median category; ‘f’ is the frequency of the median category; and‘ i’ is the
size of the median class interval. For the data in Table 11.2,
</p>

<p>

   Uses: The median can be used for ordinal or interval level data, but not for nominal level data.
It can be used very effectively when extreme items are likely to unduly affect the mean.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000310">310</pagenum>

 <h1>
	  page no:310
</h1>

   Evaluation: The median is a simple concept. It is the central point in a distribution. Like the
mode, it cannot be manipulated arithmetically. But is it relatively stable, as it is not
influenced by grouping procedures. There is only one median for any set of data.

<h1>
	Related Measures: Quartiles, Deciles and Centiles
</h1>

  <p>
	 At times we may be interested in positions other than middle one. The most common non-
middle positions are quartiles, deciles and centiles.
</p>

<p>
	   Quartiles are measures of location which divide a distribution into four equal parts. The first
quartile, Q1, is the point which has 25% of the cases below it and 75% above it. The second quartile
is of course the median. The third quartile Q3, has 75% of the cases below it and 25% of the cases
above it. The following formulas are used for computing Q1, and Q3.
</p>



<p>
	  Deciles are measures that divide a distribution into ten equal parts. The first decile, D1 has 10%
of the cases below it and 90% above. The third decile D3 has 30% of the cases below it. The fifth
decile D5 is the median. The ninth decile D9 has 90% of cases below it. The formulas for D1 and D9
</p>


<p>
	   Centiles (or percentiles) are measures that divide a distribution into one hundred equal parts.
The logic and procedures Of calculation are as above. As an illustration, let us compute C85 (the
point below which 85% of the cases fall):

 <h1>
Arithmetic Mean, page no: 311
</h1>

<p>
	 This is what is commonly known as the ‘average’. It is the average of all values in a distribution
The mean of a set of an ungrouped data is the sum of all values divided by the number of items. For
example, the mean of a series 2,5,8.6,9 is 30/5 = 6. In statistical notation, the mean is usually
designated by the symbol x (read as X-bar) and its simple computational formula is:
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000312">312</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 page no:312
</h1>

 <p>
	Evaluation: Unlike the mode and the median, the arithmetic mean is based on all the values
is the distribution. Hence, it is sensitive to extreme values. The mean will thus be a misleading
measure when extreme values are present. But it is amenable to mathematical calculations.
</p>

<h1>
	Choice of an appropriate average
</h1>

<p>
	  It is important to know when and where to use the different measures of central tendency. The
choice depends upon the consideration of several factors: (1) the level of measurement; (2) the
shape of the data distribution, and (3) the research objective.
</p>

<p>
	   Level of measurement:* Since the mode requires only a frequency count, it can be applied to
any set of data at the nominal, ordinal or interval level of data.


   The median requires an ordering of items from the highest to the lowest or vice versa. Hence
it can obtained from an ordinal or interval level of data and not from nominal data (like party
classification, caste or religion).

  The use of mean is exclusively restricted to interval (and ratio) data such as income, age, wage
rate, and test score.
</p>

<h1>
	shape of the distribution
</h1>

<p>
	In a perfectly symmetrical, unimodal distribution, the mode, the median and the mean will be identical.
</p>

<p>
	 In a skewed distribution, the mode falls closest to the ‘peak’ of the curve; the mean falls closest
to the tail; and the median somewhere between the mode and the mean. It is this characteristic that
makes the median the most desirable measure of central tendency for describing a skewed distribution of data.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000313">313</pagenum>

<h1>
	 page no:313
</h1>


<p>
	  When the researcher works with a symmetrical distribution, his choice of measure of central
tendency is chiefly based on his particular research purpose and the data’ s level of measurement.
</p>

 <p>
	 To describe bimodal distributions, it is necessary to identify both modes; the use of either
median or mean will obscure the important aspects of such distributions.
</p>

<p>
	     Research objective: What 1s the purpose of the measure to be used? What does the researcher
expects to do with his measure of central tendency? If he seeks a simple crude descriptive measure
he can use the mode. If he wants to find out the most common or the typical category (e. g., the most
common caste or the typical income level or test score), the mode is the most appropriate measure,
If an average figure is required for further mathematical manipulations, the arithmetic mean is the
most appropriate measure. To describe a skewed distributi,on the median is preferable. It is also
when the midvalue is to be identified. For a precise measure of symmetrical distributions, the mean
is preferable over the median, as the mean is more stable than the. median and amenable for
advanced statistical analysis.

	                     11.3 MEASURES OF DISPERSION
</h1>

<h1>
Introduction
</h1>

<p>
	    The measures of central tendency indicate the central value of a distribution. However, the
central value alone is not suﬁcient to fully describe the distribution. In addition to the measure of
centrality, we require a measure of the spread of the actual scores. The extent of such spread may vary
from one distribution to another. For example, two income distributions may have the identical mean,
but they may present different patterns of distribution: in one most incomes may cluster around the
mean, and in another, the incomes may be widely dispersed, i.e., one distribution has less variability
than another. The extent of such Variability is measured by measures of dispersion. The most common
measures of dispersion are: the range, the mean, absolute deviation, the variance, the standard
deviation, and the coefficient of variation.
</p>

<h1>
	Range
</h1>

<p>
	   The range (R) measures the difference between the highest and lowest scores of a distribution.
For example, in a set of values 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, the range is the difference between 12 and 3, i. e
.,— 3=9. This measure requires ordering of scores according to size. It can thus he applied in
cases where the distribution is at least on an ordinal level of measurement.
</p>

<p>
	     Evaluation: The range is easy to compute and understand. It is a useful device for gaining a
quick impression of dispersion. It is useful for computation of the standard deviation, the most
important measure of deviation. As illustrated in EXhibit 11.1 (below) six standard deviations cover
almost the entire distance, from the highest to lowest score in a distribution. Hence, the size of the
standard deviation is approximately one sixth of the size of the range. This rule is useful in checking
the calculation of the standard deviations. However, it is a crude measure of dispersion, because it
suffers from several limitations. First, as it is based on the two extreme values only, even if one
the extreme value changes, the range will fluctuate sharply. It is thus, sensitive to extreme values
Second, the ranges cannot be compared with each other unless they are based on a similar number
of observations. Third, the range does not give us any information about the pattern of variation.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000314">314</pagenum>

<h1>
Intermediate Ranges, page no:314
</h1>

<p>
  An  alternative 10 the range is an intermediate range like interquartile range or interdecile range.

  The interquartile range is the difference between the third and the first quartiles (Q3 — Q1). It
measures the spread in the middle half of the distribution, and is less affected by extreme values. It
in thus a more stable measure of dispersion that is the range. Consider the data in Table 11.2. The
Q3 and Q1 for those data are 68. 6 and 35.0 respectively. Hence the interquartile range for them is 68.6-35.0= 33.6.
</p>

<p>
	 The principle of the interquartile range can be applied to any parts of the distribution. For
example, one can calculate the range between the ninth and first deciles (D9 and D1).

  The great virtue of the above intermediate ranges is that they reduce the influence of extreme
scores.
</p>

<h1>
	Measures of Aggregate Dispersion
</h1>

<p>

   The range, the interquartile range and other forms of range have a major drawback in that, being
based on two values alone, they reflect only the dispersion in some defined section of the distribution,
but  not the aggregate dispersion in it. To overcome this drawback, some measures of aggregate
dispersion have been devised. They include: the mean deviation, the variance, the standard
deviation and co-efficient of variance.
</p>

<p>
	 In these measures, the deviations of all scores in the distribution from some norm are computed.
Any of the measures of central tendency can be chosen as a norm. However, the arithmetic mean is
most commonly used because of its mathematical properties.
</p>

<h1>
	Mean Absolute Deviation (MD)
</h1>

<p>
	This is one of the measures of aggregate dispersion based on all values in a distribution. It
is computed as follows.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000315">315</pagenum>

 <h1>
	page no:315
</h1>

<p>
	the sum of actual deviations using signs is always zero. The plus and minus deviations cancel
themselves out, and therefore cannot be used to describe or compare the variability of distributions.
The sum of absolute deviations without signs is 12, which is divided by the number of scores.
12/5=2.4. Thus the mean deviation is 2.4.

      The mean deviation can also be computed from the median or the mode.

      The relationship between the mean, the range and the mean deviation is illustrated in
</p>

<p>
	   When the ranges and the mean deviations of distributions with identical means vary, the variability
of the distributions will be low or high, corresponding to the value of the range and the mean
deviation.
</p>

<p>
	    Evaluation: The MD takes into account all values in a distribution, and so represents the
aggregate or overall dispersion. However, the absolute values, on which the MD is based, are not
amenable to mathematical manipulations. Hence the MD 18 not useful for advanced statistical
analysis Moreover, the MD does not provide us with much information about a distribution.
</p>

<h1>
	The variance (V) and the Standard Deviation (5D)
</h1>

<p>
	    These measures of dispersion are based on the square deviations of all values (or scores) from
the mean. These measures thus eliminate the drawback of the MD. The computation of the Variance
(V) and the standard deviation (SD) is similar to that of MD, except that deviations of scores
from the mean are squared and then summed up and divided by n, the total number of observations.
</p>

<p>
	The variance is the means of the squared deviations from the mean of a distribution.
</p>

<p>
	Evaluation: The variance expresses the average dispersion not in the original units of
measurement but in squared units. This problem is solved by taking the square root of variance.
This transforms the variance into the standard deviation.
</p>

<p>
	   The standard deviation (SD) is the square root of the mean of the squared deviation from the
mean of a distribution. The SD is a measure which, unlike the variance, expresses dispersion  in the

 deviation, the  greater the variability around the mean of the distribution.

<h1>

 <p>
	 Evaluation: The SD is more useful than other measures of dispersion. The reasons are: (1) The
SD is more stable from sample to sample. (2) Its mathematical properties makes it possible to obtain
standard division for two or more groups combined. (3) It 1s more useful 1n more advanced statistical
analysis especially in statistical inferences. (See Section 6.5 of Chapter 6, above; Sections 11.6
and 11.7 of this Chapter, below).
</p>

<h1>
	Co-efficient of Variation
</h1>

 <p>
	The standard deviations cannot be compared in absolute magnitudes when the distributions
Compared have very different means. A standard deviation of 2, for instance, would convey a different
meaning in relation to a mean of 7 than to a mean of 75. Therefore the degree of variability must be
calculated in relation to the mean of the distribution. This is measured by a measure called the
coefficient  of variation (CV). The CV indicates the relative variation. It is computed by the
following formula
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000319">319</pagenum>

<h1>
	page no:319
</h1>

 <p>
     In absolute magnitudes (see Table 11.8) there are no significant differences among the standard
deviations in the four co-operatives. However, there are substantial differences between the means
indicating the varying degrees of democratic participation in each co-operative. CVs show that the
relative deviation from the mean is higher in C than in other  co-operatives, reflecting the lower degree
of homogeneity in democratic participation (i. e., the higher degree of variability in democratic
participation in it).
</p>

<h1>
	Standard Deviation and the Normal Distribution
</h1>

<p>
	    The standard deviation is the most important measure of dispersion. This importance arises
from its special relationship with the normal distribution.
</p>

<p>
	     A normal distribution is unimodal and symmetric. (See Section 6. 4, above). When graphed
a frequency curve, this distribution takes the familiar bell- -shaped curve which can be used as a
approximation of the distribution of numerous variables like IQ scores, heights of males,
measurement errors, sampling distributions and others.
</p>

<p>
	    In a normal distribution, the proportion of the area lying under the curve between any two points
can be specified. For example, the distance between the mean and+ one standard deviation
occupies 34.13% the area under curve: therefore the distance between - and +  include 61.26
of the area; the distance between +20 and —20 includes 95. 44% the area of; and the distance
between and includes 99. 7% areas. (See Exhibit 11.1)

</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000320">320</pagenum>

  <h1>
	  page no:320
</h1>

<p>
	 We can similarly define the area corresponding to the distance between any two points, when
those points are expressed as standard deviation units.
</p>

<h1>
	Standard Deviation Units or Standard Scores
</h1>

<p>
	The standard scores provide a method of expressing any score in a distribution in terms of its
distance from the mean in standard deviation units. There are two common types of standard scores:
(1) z— score and (2) Z or T — score.
</p>

 <p>
	  z- scores: A z- score is a measure of deviation from the mean relative to the standard
deviation; that is, it is a deviation score expressed in standard deviation units.
</p>


<p>
	 A z- score thus expresses any raw score as being so many standard deviations above or below
the mean. Suppose we have a normal distribution whose mean is 20 and the standard deviation is 4.
If one of the scores in this distribution is 28, this score 8 units above the mean. If we divide this
deviation score,*2=8=(28—20), by the standard deviation, we obtain a z— score of +2. In other
words, the raw score of 28 lies two standard deviation units above the mean.
</p>

<p>
	We can convert any normal distribution into a standard normal distribution by converting the
raw scores into z- scores. A standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of zero
and a standard deviation and variance of one. All z- scores have some of the properties of a standard
normal distribution, i. e., the mean of the z- scores is zero, and the standard deviation and
variance of z- scores are equal to one.
</p>

<p>
	z- scores make it easier to compare groups of scores or variables on an equally weighted basis
.They are also useful in hypothesis testing, determination of percentile ranks and probability judgement.
</p>

<p>
		Z - score: Another version of a standard score is Z or T- score. This has been devised to avoid
some confusion resulting from the negative z- score (below the mean) and also to eliminate decimal
values.

	11.4 MEASURES OF ASSOCIATION/ RELATIONSHIP, page no:321
</h1>

<h1>
	Bivariate Analysis
</h1>

<p>
	Once the data relating to single variables are summarized and their pattern of distribution
studied, the researcher’s next task is to examine the pattern of relationship between the
variables under study. This section examines the important measures of association/ relationship
between two variables.
</p>

<h1>
	The Concept of Relationship
</h1>

<p>
	In the world around us, we observe association between things. As children grow, their weight
increases; application of fertilizers increases crop yield; cities tend to be more polluted than rural
areas; when the demand for a commodity expands, its price tends to rise up; and so on. Each  of these
observations is a statement of relationship: between age and weight; fertilizer application and crop
yield; degree of urbanization and pollution; demand and price. To state a relationship between X and
Y, is to say that certain categories of variable X go with certain categories of variable Y. This is the
principle of covariation and it is basic to the notion of assoCiation or relationship.
</p>

<p>
	In examining the relationship between. variables, we have to consider certain questions: is there
a relationship between the variables under study? If so, what is the direction and degree of their
relationship? Is the relationship a causal one? Is the relationship statistically significant? The answers
to these questions are provided by different statistical techniques and the related tests of significance.
The most important measures of association between two variables are: (a) cross tabulation and
percentage difference, (9) association coefficients: Lamda, Goodman and Kruskal’ s tau, Gamma,
Kendall’s tau and Somer’ s d, (c) correlation coefficient, and (d) regression analysis.
</p>

<p>
	Cross tabulation and percentage difference, Lambda and Goodman &amp; Kruskal’s Tau are used
for measuring association between nominal levell variables. Gamma, Kendall’s tau-b, Somer’s d, and
Spearman’s Rank- order Correlation Coefficient (Rho) are used for ordinal variables. When both the
independent and the dependent variables are interval or ratio level measures, correlation or regression
analysis is used. The correlation analysis shows whether there is association between the
variables, whereas the regression analysis helps in judging causal relationship.
</p>


<h1>
	Cross Tabulation and Percentage Difference
</h1>

<p>
	The percentage difference in a cross table is used for measuring association between nominal
level variables. Nominal variables are purely qualitative and can be categorized only.

A two-way table (Table 11.9) is prepared. The values for one variable are put along one side
of the table and the values of the other variable along the other side of the table. Each variable is
categorized into two or more categories; and the variables are cross-tabulated for those sub
-categories. The percentages are computed for them On the basis of the percentages, Conclusions are drawn.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000322">322</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:322
</h1>

<p>
	   When a researcher finds that a relationship exists between two variables, he must investigate
its direction. When one variable increases, the other also increases; a direct or positive
relationship exists
between them. Example, relationship exists between income and education; children’ s age and weight
. When one variable increases, the other decreases, there is a negative or inverse relationship between them, example, supply and price; socio-economic statUs and family size.
</p>

<p>
    The strength of a relationship is determined by the pattern of differences between the values of
variables. If there are marked percentage differences between the different categories of the variables,
the relationship between them IS strong, if the differences are slight the relationship is weak. In Table 11. 10 we find that the relationship between the variables is strong.
</p>

<p>
	   The statistical significance of a relationship is determined by using an appropriate test of
significance. The tests of significance are discussed in a separate section in this chapter. The
stronger relationship is the more likely it is to be statistically significant.
</p>

<h1>
	prediction and Proportional Reduction of Error (PRE)
</h1>

<p>
	 The notion of prediction is inherent in the concept of covariation. When two variables covary,
it is possible to use one to predict the other.

    Suppose we have a group of fifty farmers and we know that twenty of them have a record of
loan delinquency, while thirty have no such record. Suppose we are asked to guess the delinquency
status of each farmer. Since our information is minimal, the best prediction is to use the mode. Here
the mode is delinquent and the modal frequency is thirty. By guessing that each of the fifty farmers
is delinquent we will be correct in thirty cases and wrong in twenty cases. Our prediction based on
the mode has resulted in 20 errors in prediction or an error rate of 20/50 i .e., 40%. But suppose
we add a second variable and thus have a second piece of information; twenty-six of the farmers are
members of Farmers’ Association and twenty-four are not. Let us arrange the data in a cross—table
(Table 11.11).
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000323">323</pagenum>

 <h1>
	  page no:323
</h1>

 <p>
	   Let us predict delinquency on the basis of association membership status of each farmer. Our
prediction rule is to use within category mode. For the twenty-six farmers who are members of
Farmers Association, the within-category mode is delinquent and if we guess all members are
delinquent, our prediction results in four errors or an error rate of 4/26 = 15%. Similarly, for the
twenty-four farmers who are not members of Farmers’ Association, we predict non-delinquent (since
within the category of non— member, the mode is non- delinquent) and make eight errors in prediction
or an error rate of 8/24=33%. In total we have made 4 + 8 errors, and our error rate is (4+8)/(26
+24)=12/50 24%.
</p>

    <p>  We can now know the advantage of using another variable (association membership). It reduces
our error rate from 40% to 24%. This is known as the Proportional Reduction of Error (PRE). Thus
is defined as

PRE= (E1 — E2) / E1

where E1 = original number of errors based on the dependent variable’s mode.

     E2 = new number of errors after employing independent variable as a predictor.

   The PRE is thus achieved when we shift from one prediction rule to another. These rules are:

PR 1: To predict the dependent variable, use its own mode.

PR 2: To predict the dependent variable, use the within category modes of the independent
variable.

    A measure of association can be developed on the basis of the above PRE modal.
</p>

<h1>
	Lambda
</h1>

  <p>
	This measure of relationship was developed by Louis Guttman. 2 It is also known as the Guttman
Co—efficient of Predictability. It is suitable for measuring association between nominal variables. it is based on PRE model discussed earlier.

   Lambda IS defined as the co-efficient of reduction of prediction error achieved by shifting from
one prediction rule (overall mode) to another (within -category modes).
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000325">325</pagenum>

 <h1>
	  page no: 325
</h1>

 <p>
   In such situations, the Lambda is said to be insensitive. In these cases, any other measure of
association such as Goodman &amp; Kruskal’s Tau3 must be used.
</p>

<h1>
	   Goodman &amp; Kruskal's Tau
</h1>

<p>
	   This is a PRE and asymmetric measure of association for nominal data. It can be applied when
Lambda is inappropriate.
</p>

 <p>
	   The main difference between Lambda and GK’s Tau lies in the method Of computing errors.
Whereas the prediction rules for Lambda are based on modes, the predictiOn rules for Tau are based
on the concept of random assignment of subjects within the table. The prediction rules for Tau are
</p>

<p>
	   PR 1: A11 n cases are to be randomly assigned to categories of the dependent variable:

   If, in Table 11.12, we randomly assign eleven of the fifty cases to the delinquent category of
the dependent variable, we will make on the whole on average, (11) x (39/50)=8.58 errors. Similarly
the random assignment of thirty- -nine cases to the non- delinquent category will yield on average
(39) x (ll/50)=8.58 errors. Therefore, E1, the number of errors made from using PR1 is (8.58+8.58)
=17.16.
</p>

<p>
	  PR 2: Within each category of the dependent variable, each case is to be randomly assigned
a category of the dependent variable.

   In Table 11. 12, we have twenty- -six cases within the category of association member. If we
randomly assign these twenty- six cases to non- delinquent category we will make (26) x (0/26)=0
errors in prediction. If we assign the twenty- six cases to the delinquent category we will make
(0) x (26/26)=0 errors. In non- -member category there are twenty-four cases. If we randomly assign
these twenty—four cases to the delinquent category, we will make on the average (13)x(11/24)=5.96
errors. If we assign them to the non- delinquent category, we will make on the average (11) x
(13/24) = 5.96 errors. Therefore E2, the number of errors made from using PR2 is (0+0+5.96)=11.92.

   Using the general formula we can now determine the value of Tau:
   Tau = (E1— E2)/El = (17.16 - 11.92)/17.16 = 5.24/17.16= 0.31

   Tau ranges from 0to1.00 with ‘0’ implying no reduction in error and 1.0 indicating prediction
with no error.

	Measuring Association between. Ordinal Level Variables
</h1>

<p>
	  The ordinal level variables have rank order differences. The most common measures of associations
between ordinal variables are Gamma, Kendall’s tau, Somer’s d and Spearman’s rank —Order
correleation coefficient (Rho).
</p>

<h1>
	Gamma
</h1>

<p>
	    Gamma is a measure of association developed by Goodman and Kruskal.4 It is a symmetric
measure, i. e., it yields only a single computed value for a given contingent table. It measures association.
</p>

	between two ordinal level variables. It measures one—way association i.e., it uses information
about one variable to tell us something about a second one, and it is based on pair-by-pair
comparison.
</p>

<p>
	   Let us introduce the logic of pair-by-pair comparison. Suppose two respondents X and Y are
asked to rank the product characteristics that they would consider while buying a scooter. Three
Possible sets of rankings are given in Table 11.13.
</p>

<p>
	  In (a) there is a perfect positive agreement between the two respondents, in (b) a perfect
negative agreement between them, but in (c) there are both agreement and disagreement among the
sets of ranks, example, in terms of pair-by-pair comparison the ranking of F-P pair is similar and
that of R-S pair is dissimilar.
</p>

<p>
	   After counting the number of similar and dissimilar pairs, the level of association between the
two sets of ranks is computed by the ratio of the preponderant type of pairs (similar or dissimilar
) to the total number of similar and dissimilar pairs. This value is Gamma (G or y). The simple
formula computing Gamma is

G = ns-nd/ns-nd

Where ns = the number of similar pairs

     nd = the number of dissimilar pairs

 Let us list the pairs of ranks of Table 11.13 in Table 11.14 and also record for each of the three
examples, whether a given pair is similar (S) or dissimilar (D).

Kendall's Tau, page no:328
</h1>

<p>
	When ties are many, Kendall's Tau is used. Kendall5 had described three symmetric measures
mutual association for ordinal data. They are known as Kendall's Tau, Tau-a, Tau-b, and Tau-c.
all three, like Gamma, are based on the logic of pair-by-pair comparison.

   The three Tau measures and Gamma involve the computation of ns and nd. All involve ns — nd
the numerator of the computational formula. However these four measures differ in the determination
the maximum possible number of pairs used in the denominator.

For Gamma the maximum number of pairs is (nS+nd), ties being excluded.

 <h1>
Somers‘ d, page no:329
</h1>

<p>
	 Somers6 had introduced a measure of association for ordinal data. It is known as Somers‘ d
Like Gamma and Kendall's Tau, Somers’ d is based on pair-by-pair comparison. It is asymmetric
measure.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000330">330</pagenum>


 <h1>

</h1>

 <p>
	  Comparison: All six measures discussed thus far (G, Tau- a, Tau- b, Tau- c, dyx,dxy) are similar
in that all are based on the logic of pair-by-pair comparison. But they differ on the treatment of tied
pairs. Gamma completely eliminates all tied pairs. Tau -a includes all tied pairs. Tau-b and Tau-
-c treat
all pairs as if they have complete mutual association and exclude all tied pairs. Somers’ d exclude
pairs on the independent variables only.
</p>

<p>
	   choice: Which of these measures should be used? It is not easy to make this decision. Gamma
is always the preferred measure. But it does not measure mutual association. If we wish to measure
mutual association, one of the Tau measures is preferable. Somers’ d gives us an asymmetric measure
but lacks a clear conceptual interpretation.
</p>

<p>
	Testing for significance: All the above measures are subject to tests of significance. This is
discussed in Section 11.7, Tests of Significance.
</p>

<h1>
	 Spearman’s rank- order correlation co-efficient (Rho)
</h1>

<p>
	This is the oldest of the frequently used measures of ordinal association. Rho (e) is a measure
of the extent of agreement or disagreement between two sets of ranks. It is a nonparametric measure
and so it does not require the assumption of a bivariate normal distribution. Its value ranges between
-1.0(perfect negative association) and +1.0 (perfect positive association).
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000331">331</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:331
</h1>

<p>
	Requirements for using Rho: The following conditions should be satisfied for using Rho:

1. A straight -line correlation should exist between the variables.

2. Both X and Y variables must be ranked or ordered.

3. Sample members must have been taken at random from a larger population.
</p>

<h1>
	Research Examples:
</h1>

<p>
	Sarveswara Rao (1972),7 in a study of two- factor theory of job satisfaction, used Rho. Ranks
were given to perceived needs for supervisors and clerks on each job factor according to
the magnitude of mean scores, and Rho was calculated, The calculated value was significance (Rho=
0.86, p  0.01) indicating similarity between the two groups in their perceived need importance.
</p>

<p>
  Sridharan and Radhakrishnan (1978),8 used Kendall’s rank correlation coefficient to test whether
there was any shift in the cropping pattern during 1966 to 1976 in the selected district. Ranks
were assigned to each crop on the basis of its percentage to the total cropped area. Rank coefficients of
correlation were worked out for each pairs of successive years. All coefficients were significance
at 01 level, which indicated that there was no shift in the cropping pattern.
</p>

<p>
   Sharma (1987)9 computed rank-order correlation coefficients for ranks of nine dimension
(labour-management relations, grievance handling, participative management, etc.,) between
(a) multinationals and non- multinationals, (b) multinationals and public enterprises, and (c) non-
multinationals and public enterprises. He also computed rank- order correlation coefficient between
ranks for different dimensions of organizational climate and psychological climate (Rho= 9667; df
=7; t=9.9890, p .0.01).

	 Anbalagan (1989),10 used rank-order correlation technique for examining the relationship between
the perceived importance of the values of supervisors and workers in his study on Value system

<h1>
	 Correlation Analysis, page no:332
</h1>

<p>
	   When both the independent and dependent variables are interval or ratio level measures
correlation analysis is used for measuring relationships and testing hypotheses.
</p>

 <p>
	  The correlation coefficient measures the degree of association between variables. The correlation
could be positive or negative. When two variables move in the same direction, their association is
termed positive correlation. When they move in the opposite direction, their association is said to be
negative or inverse correlation. There are also other types of correlation such as linear correlation,
non-linear correlation, simple correlation, multiple correlation and partial correlation.
</p>

<p>
	  Linear correlation refers to a positive or negative straight- line relationship. Non-linear correlation
refers to the curved line -type relationship. Simple correlation shows the relationship between two
variables, whereas multiple correlations is concerned with simultaneous correlation among three or
more variables. Partial correlation refers to the correlation between any two out of multiple
variables while the remaining variables are held constant.
</p>

<p>
	  The correlation analysis involves three main aspects. (1) measuring the degree of association
between the two variables, (2) testing whether the relationship is significant and (3) establishing the cause and effect relationship, if any.

</p>


<p>
	Requirement for using ‘r’: In order to use Pearson correlation coefficient, the following
requirements must be satisfied:

1. The distributions of X and Y should have a linear relationship.

2. The data should be expressed in interval or ratio level measures.

3. Sample members must have been drawn on a random basis.

4. The distributions should be normal, especially for small samples. This requirement is of
minor importance when the sample size is 30 Or above.

<p>
	   For measuring the correlation between curvilinear variables, Pearson ‘r’ is inappropriate; an
alternative measure called Eta-square is used. The procedure for calculating eta—square is not described
here. The interested researcher can consult: Mueller, John H., Karl F. Schuessler and Herbert L. Costner,

<p>
	  Evaluation: While the correlation analysis can determine the degree of association between
variables, it cannot show the existence of casual relationship. Only on the basis of the thorough
conceptual knowledge and reasoning we can arrive at some conclusion on the casual relationship.
</p>

<h1>
	Regression Analysis
</h1>

<p>
	In social sciences, most relationships are linear in nature and can be fitted into a linear function.
A function is said to be linear when pairs of X, Y values fall into a function that can be plotted
as a straight line. This line is represented by the equation

     Y = a + bX

where X and Y = values of X and Y variables respectively.

   a = Y-intercept or the place at which the line crosses the Y—axis or the amount of Y when
       X = O.

   b= slope of the line across the group, expressing the number of units of change in Y
      accompanying one unit of change in X.

  <h1>

</h1>

   The regression equation performs some functions. First, it describes the nature oft association.
The slope of the regression line (Y on X) is a geometric representation of the rate of change of y
with respect to X. Second, the regression equation is useful for predicting or estimating an unknown
value of one variable for a given value of the other variable. The goal is to construct such an
that the error of prediction will be at a minimum. The criterion of least squares achieves this
goal. According to this criterion, ‘a’ and ‘b’ in the regression equation can be calculated by
formulas:


<h1>
	The Standard Error of the Estimate
</h1>

<p>
	   The values of Y estimated by the regression equation may not exactly be equal to the observed
value. Thus the estimates may be in error. This is due to the fact that variations in Y may not be
exactly due to variations in X.
</p>

<p>
	   A measure for estimating this prediction error is known as the standard error of estimate. It is
a measure of the reliability of the regression prediction. It is a measure of dispersion of observed
values from the predicted values. Therefore when a prediction is made, the standard error of the
estimate may be used to estimate the confidence interval around the predicted value.

	         11.5 MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
</h1>

<h1>
Introduction
</h1>

<p>
	  In the previous section we described techniques used for analyzing the relationships between
two variables. The bivariate measures of relationship have a limited function of establishing covariation
and its direction. An observed correlation between two variables does not, of itself, permit making
casual relationships. A bivariate relationship may be the result of chance or it may exist because the
variables are related to a third, unrevealed variable. Moreover the phenomenon under study may be
Multivariate in nature and cannot be explained by a single independent variable. In either case,
the need for analyzing multiple Variables arises. The analysis of multiple variables of a phenomenon is
known as multi- variate analysis, and it involves simultaneous analysis of more than two variables
. Multi-variate analysis provides more complete explanations for complex phenomena and permit
assessing casual relationships through statistical control.
</p>

<h1>
	The Concept of Control
</h1>

<p>
  A correlation between an independent variable and a dependent variable is not a sufficient basis
for inferring causal relationship between them. The relationship between them might be caused by a
third variable that is the cause of both the independent and dependent variables. Only by eliminating
the possible effects of such other variables the original bivariate association can be validated.
A process called control, a basic principle in all research designs achieves this.
</p>

 <p>
	In experimental research, control is accomplished by dividing subjects into experimental and
control groups. The controlled experimentation assures control over extraneous variables. It is difficult
to introduce experimental control in studies of social problems In these cases, control is achieved
through statistical methods that include cross tabulation; multiple correlation, partial
correlation, Multiple regression and factor analysis.
</p>

<h1>
	Cross Tabulation
</h1>

<p>
   This is one of the simplest methods of analyzing more than two variables at a time. The process
of this method is as follows:
</p>

<p>
	  We establish first the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable
through bivariate analysis. We then select a third variable associated with the independent variable
and use it as a control variable. The sample 13 then divided into sub- -groups according to the categories
of the control variable. The bivariate association is then reassessed within each sub-group. We may
find an entirely different result. the disappearance/ weakening of the original strong relationship, or
emergence of a new relationship or existence of a strong relationship under one control condition but
not under another. The following example illustrates this process of control through cross
tabulation.
</p>

<p>
	Suppose a sample of 900 persons is selected from urban and rural areas to test the hypothesis
that urban people are politically more aware than rural people. The hypothetical data are
presented.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000337">337</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 page no:337
</h1>

<p>
	in Table 11.17. 11 is observed that 50 per cent of urban respondents have higher level of political
awareness compared with only 28 per cent of the rural respondents. Thus, it may be concluded that
political awareness is related to place of living. Whether this relationship is real or is just based on
an accidental relation with a third variable (in which case the relationship is not real or
spurious). One such additional variable might be educational level which is associated with
political awareness and place of living (see Tables 11.18 and 11.19).
</p>


<p>
	 To control for educational level, the 900 respondents are divided into two groups according to
their level of education (high, low). Within each group, urban- rural living is cross- tabulated
with political awareness. The original bivariate association is then estimated in each of the sub
-groups. (Table 11.20).
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000338">338</pagenum>

 <h1>
	     page no:338
</h1>

 <p>
	In Table 11.20 educational level completely 17 accounts for the relationship between place of
living and political awareness, for there is no difference between rural and urban respondents in their
level of political awareness within either of the tWo educational groups. The overall association
between the independent and dependent variables is completely accounted for by the association of
each with educational level.
</p>



<p>
	 Educational level determines both political awareness and place of living. That is, people who
are educated tend to live in urban areas and are generally politically aware. There is no inherent
link between political awareness and place of living and the association between them is spurious
or unreal.
</p>

<p>
    Alternatively the introduction of control variables may lead to a different result also. If they do
not change the original bivariate association then the original relationship between the independent
and dependent variables may be considered to be real. Of course, one can never be completely sure
that all relevant variables have been introduced into the analysis. However, the more relevant
factors controlled for, the greater is the confidence that the relationship is not spurious.
</p>

<p>
	Evaluation: The cross- tabulation method is popular in empirical research and it is applied to
all levels of measurement. However, this method is a tedious process. It also suffers from a serious
limitation. That is, it necessitates a subdivision of the sample into progressively smaller sub-
-groups for measuring association and thus rendering its validity and reliability questionable. The partial correlation method overcomes these drawbacks.
</p>

<h1>
	Partial  Correlation
</h1>

<p>
	 The partial correlation is a statistical method designed to measure the relation between an
independent variable and a dependent variable by holding all other related variables constant. It
cancels out the effect of the control variables on the independent and dependent variables and thus
shoes the unmarred direct association between them.

<p>
	 The multiple correlation (R) shows the combined effects of two or more independent variables
a dependent variable.
</p>

<p>
	 R always reaches maximum value relative to the zero- order coefficients when the independent
variables are not inter-correlated. Hence to improve the prediction, one should introduce the
greatest possible  variable number of relevant independent variables that are independent of each other.
</p>

 <p>
	  Correlation for sample error: If the above formula (11.41) is used on population data the
computed value of R will be accurate. However, if sample data are used, the computed value of R
will be an overestimate.

problems; problem of salary compression (i. e., the compensation gap between managers and their

performance, reduction in real salary- income on account of inflation. One theory was that companies
avoid compression problems by offering new college graduates lower salaries so as to maintain a
desired salary difference between supervisors and subordinates. To get a deeper insight into this
problem, the data were analyzed by separate academic discipline: engineering, business administration,
marketing, production, and data processing. Each organization’s previous four- year merit increase
program was correlated with its increases in offers to college graduates. Organizations with compression
problems showed a slight to moderate correlation (all significant at .02 level or better) between the
two sets of data for each discipline every year. Organizations without compression problems showed
to relationships that were significant at the .02 level.

by computing the coefficients of correlation and tested their significance by t-tests. After analyzing
the inter-correlations among independent variables, they made a multiple correlation and regression
analysis to determine the contribution of independent variables to the total variance in the dependent
variable. The multiple regression coefficients were tested by For

a study made for identifying the causes for overdue of loans among farmers. The multiple linear
regression function was fitted separately for marginal, small and large farmers with the average
overdue amount per farmer as dependent variable and non- farm income, capital investment, family
size, non- farm expenditure, debt to asset ratio and net farm inCome as independent variables. For the
regression equation, non-farm income, capital investment, debt to asset ratio and net farm income
were the independent variables. The regression coefficients on non -farm income, capital investment,
debt to asset ratio and net farm income and R2 were significant at .01 level. T-test was used as a test of significance.

<h1>
	Canonical Analysis
</h1>

<p>
   What is the relation between two sets of data with several independent and dependent variables?
Canonical analysis studies this relationship: It is a regressiOn analysis of data with ‘k’ independent
variables and ‘m’ dependent variables. Through least-squares analysis, two linear composites are
formed: one for the independent variables, and another for the dependent variables. The correlation
between these two composites is called canonical correlation. And like R, it will be
the maximum correlation possible.
</p>

<p>
	   In addition to the canonical correlation, sets of regression weights for both the independent and
dependent variables are calculated. The relative weights may be computed from the individual regression
results by squaring the standardized regression (beta) coefficients and then dividing them by the R2.
The weights can be used to determine which of the independent and dependent variables are more closely associated.
</p>

<p>
	  Pandey (1986)28 in his study of organizational and individual characteristics of R and D
organizations, has made a set of canonical analyses to substantiate the multivariate nature of the
conceived functional model of R and D organizations. In each set of analysis, the data matrix was
arranged to form a “two-set” case, namely, independent variable set (predictor) and dependent variable
set (criterion). The major objective was to explore the relationship between two given sets, three
commitment variables (namely, organizational commitment, job involvement and professional
commitment) and three rated performance measures (namely, contribution to the organizational goal
achievement, contribution to science and technology, and perceived efficiency of the scientist) were
taken as the set of criterion variables. Micro- and macro- organisatiOn- climate,
total scores and the four
personality variables were taken together as the predictor set. Canonical correlations for different
combinations of two sets of variables were computed. To test the statistical significance of a set of
canonical correlations, Wilks' Lamba test was used. The strength of relationship between the two sets
of variables, the mean square of the canonical correlation was computed.

	  Patnaik (1988),29 in his study of the pattern in the integration of groundnut markets in Rayalaseema
region of Andhra Pradesh (India), used the canonical correlation analysis to find out the produCt
identification in inter-market integration. The data of monthly prices of the groundnut pod, kernel, oil
and cake of selected six markets for pre- and post-regulation period, i.e., 1963-71 and 1972-81
respectively were used for the analysis. For each market for pre- and post-regulation periods the
canonical variates of various compositions were computed. The canonical correlation between the two
sets were calculated. These correlations in all markets were nearly one. Lambda values were computed.

<h1>
Discriminant Analysis
</h1>

<p>
	   How can individuals or members of a sample be best assigned to groups on the basis
of independent variables? Discriminant analysis deals with this question. A discriminant function is
a regression equation with a dependent variable that represents group membership This function
maximally discriminates the members of the group; it tells us to which group each member probably
belongs. It can be used to assign individuals to groups on the basis of their scores on two or more
measures. From those scores, the ‘best’ composite score based on least- squares is
calculated. Then the higher R square is the better predictor of the group membership.
</p>

<p>
	  One can use discriminant analysis to classify objects into two groups delinquent/ non- delinquent;
success/ failure; default/ non- default, etc. One can extend it to more than two groups. Cooley and
Lohnes, 3° for example, describe the discrimination among three career- plan groups. For the application
of discriminant analysis the discriminatory variables must be normally distributed.
</p>

<p>
	  The discriminant analysis has been applied in various empirical studies in psychology, behavioural
science, finance and so on. In finance, it has been used in consumer credit evaluation, earning ratio
classification, standard investment categories, rate of return prediction, and prediction of Corporate
failure. The discriminant analysis has been used in the prediction of corporate success/ failure by
Altman, Deakin, Blum, Tamer and Tisshaw, Kaveri, Sarma and Rao, Ramanathan and
Krishnaswami and so on.

	   Michael Etgar (1976)31 made a comparative study of the operational efficiencies of administratively
coordinated and market- based vertical market systems in the property and casualty insurance industry.
The market- based system operates through ‘independent insurance agents’ and the centrally coordinated
system through ‘direct writing system.’ The hypotheses state: compared with a market -coordinated
vertical marketing system, the centrally coordinated system will exhibit: (1) Less intensive contacts
among system members, (2) Less duplication of activities. (3) Higher degree of standardization of
activities, (4) Reliance on fewer product lines, (5) Faster intra system flows, (6) Better intra system
communications, (7) Lower risk of operation for system members, (8) More adoption of advanced
technologies, (9) Higher productivity. The discrete record keeping between insurers and distribution
extent of use of managerial techniques, use of mass media 1n promotion and use of electronic data
processing were analyzed by a discriminant analysis. This analysis was designed to achieve two goals:
(l) to indicate the overall power of all to differentiate between the two groups of distributions
(a) independent agents and (b) the direct writing distributors) and (2) to find out the relative importance
of each of those variables 1n describing the two groups of distributors. Twenty measurement components
of the variables were introduced into discriminant function. The discriminant coefficients were computed
for all the measurements, the centroid value for each of the two groups was arrivedat and significance
was tested by Wilk’s lambda. The derived discrimination function reflects a relatively high differentiating

	  George W. Gau (1978)32 used three multivariate techniques for developing taxonomic model for
the default risk of residential mortgages. Factor analysis provided a method of combining the mortgage
variables into linearly independent factor dimensions. Discriminant analysis was used to form functions
that indicated the relative importance of the factor dimension as discriminators between the default
and non- default mortgages. Discriminant coefficients were computed for the factor functions. F- tests

discriminant functions were derived for a three- factor discriminant model. The
cannonical correlations
were calculated for the two functions; diScriminant coefﬁcients for the three predictor variables were
computed and evaluated at the means of three sickness groups. The results showed that high relative
weight and high somatic symptoms distinguished high level sickness group from no

	Dhyani and Tewari (1988)35 used discriminant analysis for identifying the discriminatory variables
of defaulters and non-defaulters of agricultural production credit. The variables that turned out to be
significant discriminators based on discriminant analysis and step-wise regression are behavioural
Characteristics (borrower’s attitude towards savings, loan and indebtedness, litigation; motivation
towards farming and business risks), irregularity of borrower in bank customership, farming efficiency
(ratio of gross farm expenses to gross farm income), other outstanding debts in the year, per acre value
of farm assets including land, and social status. The results suggest that higher farming efficiency and
greater employment of farm assets per unit of land make a prospective borrower a good credit risk,
Whereas poor attitude towards saving, loan etc., irregularity in bank customership, other outstanding
debts and higher social status, make a prospective borrower a bad credit risk.

	differences between those who remained with the company and those who left. The 26 independent
variables were: company rating, job security, seven job satisfaction dimensions, four role conflict
dimensions, four role ambiguity dimensions, and nine measures of sales performance. The dependent
variable was the dichotomy between those who stayed and those who left. Because the purpose of the
research was to explain how the two groups differed ——, and not prediction —— step-wise analysis was
not done. Discriminant coefficients for the 26 variables were computed and the canonical loadings for
them were calculated. The canonical correlation, an index of discrimination (R = 04572
), was significant
(Wilks’ Lambda = 0.7909, F(26_, 173) ,= 1.7588, p = 0.0180). The result indicates that the variables
discriminate between those who left and those who stayed. The canonical loadings determine the rank
Order of importance of the variables. Satisfaction with the job and promotional
opportunities were the two most important discriminators followed by job security.

<h1>
	Factor Analysis
</h1>

 <p>
	The factor analysis is another multivariate technique. It is an extremely powerful and useful
analytic approach to psychological. behavioural, financial and other types of data. It is a statistical
technique for determining the underlying factors or forces among a large number of interdependent
variables or measures. It is a method for extracting common factor variances from a set of observations.
It groups the number of variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated factors potentially conveying a
great deal of information. It tells us what variables belong together — which ones
virtually measure the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	The factor analysis is an appropriate technique for cases where the variables have a high degree
of intercorrelation. A factor is a construct, a hypothetical entity that is assumed to underlie tests,
scales, items or any other measures. For example, a number of factors underlie
intelligence: verbal ability, numerical ability, reasoning, memory and others.
</p>

<p>
   If a test measures one factor only, it is said to be factorially “pure.” To the extent that a test
measures factor it is said to be loaded on the factor or saturated with the factor. Some measures
are so complex that it is difficult to tell just what they measure, e. g., grades secured by students. if
a test contains more than one factor, it is said to be factorially complex.

   We need an objective method to determine the number of factors, the variables
loaded on the various factors and the magnitude of the loadings.
</p>

<p>
 Methods of Factor Analysis: There are several methods of factor analysis. The
 important  methods are: (a) the centroid method, and (b) the principal components
 method.

Let us first state the meanings of some of the basic concepts relating to factor analysis.

Factor: A factor is an underlying dimension bf several related variables. There can be one or
more factors in a phenomenon depending upon its nature and the number of variables involved in it.

Factor loadings: These are values that explain how closely the variables are related to each one
of the factors discovered. They are factor-variable correlations. It IS the absolute
size of the loadings that is important in the interpretation of a factor.

Communality (h2): It shows how much of each variable is accounted for by the
underlying factors taken together. It is computed as under:

h2 of a variable = (its factory loading of Factor A)2 +(its factor loading of Factor B)2 +....
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000350">350</pagenum>


<h1>
	  page no:350
</h1>

 <p>
	 Eigen value (or Latent Root) is the sum of squared values of factor loadings relating to a
factor. It indicates the relative importance of each factor in accounting for the
particular set of variables under study.
</p>

<p>
	  Total sum of squares: When Eigen values of all factors are totalled, the resulting
value is called the total sum of squares.
</p>

<p>
	  Rotations reveal different structures in the data. If the factors are independent,
 orthogonal nation is done, and if they are correlated an oblique rotation is made.
</p>

<p>
	    Factor score represents the degree to which each respondent gets high scores on the
 group of item that load high on each factor. Factor scores are used in several other
 multivariate analysis.
</p>

 <p>
	Now we can take up the important methods of factor analysis.

1. Centroid method: This method Was developed by L.L.Thrustone. It tends to maximize the
sum of loading for each factor. It was frequently used before the advent of high speed
computers. For a detailed description of this method, see Nunnally Jum C.,
Psychometric Theory, New York: McGraw-Hill, 1978, pp.349-357.

2.The Principle Components method:37 This was developed by H.Hotelling. This is the
most popular method used after the advent of high speed computers.
</p>

<p>
	 The steps involved in this method are:

1. Compute the correlation coefficients (by the product moment method) between the pairs of k variables.

2. Layout the above coefficients in a correlation matrix called R.

 The R matrix is always a square and symmetric array. This is because the lower half of the
matrix below the diagonal (from upper left to loWer right) is the same as the upper half of the matrix.
The top row is the same as the first column, the second row the same as the second column and so
on. By inspecting the R matrix, we can determine the uncle lying factors (1. e., common to the variables).
If we find two or more clusters of high value of r, they indicate the common factors
underlying the variables.

3. Obtain the sum of coefficients in each column of the matrix. The vector of these sum is called as Ual.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000351">351</pagenum>

<h1>
	 page no:351
</h1>

<p>
4. Square and sum up the column sums and compute the square root of these sums.
   root is termed as normalizing factor.

5. Divide each element in Ual (obtained in step 3) by the normalizing factor to get the vector (Val).

6. Multiply accumulately elements in Val by the first row of R to obtain the first element in
a new vector Ua2. That is multiply the first element in Va by the rll value in te first row
of R, second element in Val by X r12 value, the third element in Va by rl3 value, and
so on. The total of these products would be the first element in Ua2.

7. Repeat the same process for the second and other rows of R to get the second and
subsequent elements in Ua2.

8. Normalize Ua2 to obtain Va2.

9. Compare Val and Va2. If they are nearly identical, then convergence is said to have occurred.
(If convergence does not occur one should go on computing, Va3, va4 and so on untill
convergence occurs. Suppose it occurs at Va6, in which case Va5 will be taken as va (the Characteristic vector).

10. Multiply each element of Va by its normalizing factor.

  The resulting figures are the loadings on the first principal component on factor A

11. Obtain the first residual matrix, R by multiplying the loadings for each pair of variables factor A, and repeat the above procedure to obtain factor B.

12. Repeat the above procedure again and again to obtain successive factors, C, D, etc

13. Select the factors to be retained in the study. Kaiser’s criterion is often used for this purpose.
According to this criterion, the factors having latent root greater than one are considered essential and should be retained.

14. Construct a factor matrix, a table of correlatiOn coefficients between the variables retained factors.

15. Rotate the retained principal components from their beginning positions to
    interpretability of the factors.

16. Work out communality (h2), which shows how much of each variable is accounted for by
the underlying factors taken together. The amount of variance explained (sum of
squared loadings) by each factor 18 equal to the corresponding characteristic root. When these roots
are divided by the number of variables, they show the characteristic roots as
proportions of  total variance explained.

The factor scores are used in further analysis as inputs

17. Regress the variables against each factor loading and the resulting regression coefficient are used to generate what are known as factor scores.

 The factor scores are used in further analysis as inputs.

 Rotation Principles: To guide the factor analyst in his rotations, Thrustone has laid down five
principles or rules of simple structure. 38 The rules are applicable to both
orthogonal and oblique methods of rotations. The rules are as follows:
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000352">352</pagenum>

<h1>
	   page no:352
</h1>

<p>
1. Each row of the factor matrix should have at least one loading close to zero.

2. For each column of the factor matrix, there should be at least as many variables with zero or near zero loadings as there are factors.

3. For every pair of factors (columns) there should be several variables with loadings in one factor (column) but not in the other.

4. When there are four or more factors, a large proportion of the variables should have negligible (close to zero) loadings on any pair of factors.

5. For every pair of factors (columns) of the factor matrix there should be a small number of  variables with appreciable loadings in both columns.
</p>

<p>
	These criteria call for as ‘pure’ variables as possible, i. e., each variable loaded on as few factors
as possible. In this way, the simple possible interpretation of the factors can be achieved. Thus,
nation to achieve a simple- structure is a fairly objective way to achieve simplicity
or to reduce variable complexity.
</p>

<p>
  R-type and Q-type Factor Analyses: Factor analysis may be R-type analysis or Q-type analysis.
In R-type analysis high correlations occur when respondents who score high on variable 1 also score
high  on variable 2, and respondents who score low on variable 1 also score low on
variable 2. Factors emerge  when there are high correlations within groups of
variables.
</p>

<p>
In Q-type factor analysis the correlations are computed between pairs of respondents instead
of pairs of variables. High correlations occur when respondent 1’s pattern of responses on all variables
is much like respondent 2’s pattern of response. Factors emerge when there are high correlations
within groups of people. Q-type analysis is useful when the objective is to sort out
people into groups based on their simultaneous responses to all the variables.
</p>

<p>
	  Factor analysis is used in developing psychological tests, media readership profiles of people,
for condensing and simplifying multivariate data, for providing a classification
scheme for clustering products, media or people and so on.

ranged from 36% to 11% in group- 1 and from 34. 2%t to 15.1% in group-2. It may be noted that if
six factors were chosen instead of the four selected 1n the study (the choice Was limited to four due

technical, company policies and practices, job security). This analysis failed to reveal context-content
dichotomy as hypothesised by the two-factor theory. In order to gain a better understanding factor
analysis was made. The principal components analysis was done for the thirteen job variables to
extract the factors and the same were rotated by varimax analytical rotation. The loadings of the first
factor suggest that it is a hygiene factor. The second factor has high loading on mostly motivator
variables and hence a motivator factor. The third factor is a mixed one. Regarding clerks, the first
factor appears to be a motivator one, the ,second factor is a: mixed one: as it has high loadings on the

	 Gau (1978)41 employed factor analysis along with discriminant analysis in a study made for
developing a taxonomic model for risk rating of residential mortgages. The total sample of 212 default
and 873 non—default mortgages was subjected to a principal component analysis of 64 variables
relating to financial aspects, property mortgages and socio-economic characteristics of the borrower.
Twenty-eight factors were retained for a varimax rotation and further anlaysis factors accounting for
78% of the original variance in the mortgage sample. After a rotation of the 28 factors, the rotated
factor loading matrix of factor scores was constructed. The factor scores were derived through a least
square solution. The factor loadings were correlation coefficients showing the relationship among the
original variables and the derived factors — the higher a specific loading, the stronger the relationship
between the variable and the factor. For example, factor 1 had high loadings for five mortgage
variables: monthly payment on mortgage, monthly payment on property, purchase price, primary
borrower’s income and total family income. These variables represent ‘financial standing’ dimension.
The other dimensions so identified include: financial obligations, property, job
security and the like The factor scores were then used in a discriminant analysis.

did not reveal and interpretable factor structure. However, a three factor solution and subsequent
rotation showed evidence of three interpretable factors, which may be called ‘internalized professional
value’, ‘calculative involvement’, and ‘major satisfaction of life.’ The factor analysis revealed that the

They performed an orthogonal, exploratory factor analysis of nine structural variable ( structural liaison devices, liaison in decision-making, formalization, controls, specialization, centralization,
proportion of managerial personnel to total personnel, number of operating sites, vertical span), using
varimax rotation to exclude the least consistent structural dimensions. The four composite dimensions
of the variables examined were formulation, complexity, centralization and integration. The factor
loadings on complexity variables were below .30. Hence, the complexity dimension was dropped and
the other three were used as inputs in further analysis.

	   Mount and Thompson (1987)46 studied the effects of cognitive categorization of raters on
accuracy, leniency, and halo of performance evaluation of managers in an organization. The
questionnaire used by them consisted of three sections: background information, behavioural

14 behavioural items (processing paper-work, developing new solutions, documenting decision, etc.)
deigned to measure managerial job performance. These fourteen items were inter- correlated. The
matrix of intercorrelations (14 x 14) was subjected to matrix. The factor analysis was performed on
mean ratings across raters for each manager on each of the 14 behavioural dimensions. First, the
subordinate ratings for each item were averaged for each manager. Then the three rating constituencies
(supervisor, self and subordinate) were unit weighted, summed and divided by three. The resulting
valued were used as the data for the factor analysis. The principal- -components method was used.
Three faCtors (general supervision, motivation” expertise) with Eigen values greater
than 1.0 were extracted and used as variables in further analysis.

	  Akhtar and Nishat (1988)47 used factor analysis in a study of variations in cotton yields in the
  Tharprakar district of Sind province (Pakistan). Initially 57 variables pertaining to cultural practices,
input usage, extension service, tenancy and land use characteristics and the farmer’s education were
employed to search for a meaningful factor solution. However, the determinant of correlation matrix
was nearly singular (.9728 D- 10). A second look at the data and their correlation matrix revealed that
the correlation of several variables with yield was near to zero, and the variability in a few others was
negligible. Such variables were excluded and the remaining 40 variables were included in the final

	factor solution. It yielded 16 factors. Out of them four factors which account for 45 per cent of the
aggregate variation in the data and also account for 77 per cent of the total variation in cotton yields
explained by 16 factors. 14 variables have significant factor loadings with one or the other of the
selected four factors. These variables include per acre use of urea at flowering stage, the proportion
of area hand and plough-weeded, the number of sprays, ownership pattern, the proportion of cotton
area sharecropped, the farmer’s education, and farmer’s visits to the extension staff. These variables are positively related to yields.

	  Gupta (1988)48 employed factor analysis to find out whether the dimensions of fluency, flexibility,
originality, elaboration, seeing problems, inquisitiveness and persistency were fundamental dimensions
of creativity; Five different creativity tests were administered to a sample of 200 graduate students
to test the above four dimensions of creativity. The raw scores 5 x 4 kg 20 dimensions were normalized
on the T-scale and then correlations were computed. The correlation matrix was put into factor
analysis using Thurstone’s centroid method. Oblique rotation was made and the method of extended
vectors was used. The results show that creativity is patterned on the model of       ‘structure of intellect
given by Guilford. Different types of creative abilities are needed in different field of activity for producing different products in different ways.

<h1>
	Cluster Analysis
</h1>

<p>
  Cluster analysis is a method for classifying variables into clusters. A cluster consists of variables
that correlate highly with one another and have comparatively low correlations with variables in other
clusters. The objective of cluster analysis is to determine how many mutually and exhaustive groups
or clusters, based on the similarities of profiles among entities, really exist in the population and then to state the composition of such groups.

 The cluster analysis is found useful in market research studies. This analysis is useful for
segmenting the market for a product on the basis of the various characteristics of the customers. For
a detailed discussion of cluster anlaysis, see Tryon R. C, and D. E. Bailey, Cluster
Analysis, New York. McGraw-Hill, 1970.
</p>

<h1>
	Research Example
</h1>

<p>

	 Gau (1978)49 used cluster analysis in developing a taxonomic model for risk -rating resident
mortgages. First factor dimensions were extracted through factor analysis. Second, discriminant analysis
was made to determine the relative importance of the factor dimensions as discriminators between  the
defaulters and non-defaulters. With the factor dimensions as defining characteristics and the discriminant
coefficients as weights, cluster analysis was then applied, employing the MIKCA Cluster Program
Cluster analysis provided a classification procedure for grouping the mortgages into a small number
of mutually exclusive categories based on the similarity of the characteristics of the mortgages as
measured through a distance function. The groupings of the mortgages on the basis of
the factor dimensions allowed for the elimination of the effects of the scale and multicollinearity on the cluster's distance measures.

	Latent Structure Analysis, Page no:358
</h1>

<p>

  This analysis shares both of the objectives of factor analysis, viz., to extract latent factors and
express relationship of observed (manifest) variables with the latent factors as their indicators and to
classify a population of respondents into pure types. This analysis is appropriate
when the variables involved in a study do not possess dependency relationship and
happen to be non-metric.

<h1>
Path Analysis
</h1>

<p>
	  The term ‘path analysis’ was first introduced by a biologist Sewall Wright in 1934 in connection
with decomposing the total correlation between any two variables in a causal system. This analysis
is based on a series of multiple regression analysis with the assumption of causal relationship between
independent and dependent variables. This analysis lays emphasis on the heuristic use
of visual digram (described as a path diagram and uses standardised partial regression coefficients) (known beta weights) as effect coefficients.
</p>

<p>
	  The main principle of ‘path analysis is that a correlation coefficient between two variables can be
decomposed into a series of paths: separate paths of influence leading through an intermediate
variable to which both the correlated variables have links. This analysis makes explicit the assumptions
underlying the causal connections and elucidates the indirect effect of the explanatory variables. For
a fuller discussion see Takeuchi K, et al., The Foundations of Multivariate Analysis,
New Delhi: wiley Eastern Ltd., 1982.

<h1>
	Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
</h1>

<p>
	 The significance of the difference between the means of two categories (e. g., males and females;
trained and untrained; liberals and conservatives) can be evaluated by the z-test or the t-test.50 But
when the comparison among three or more categories or samples has to be made simultaneously, the
use of t-test is not only tedious, but also increases the probability of making type I error. To overcome
this, difficulty, a method known as the analysis of variance (ANOVA) has been developed.
</p>

 <p>
	 The ANOVA is very much useful in researches in social sciences and other disciplines. It is
appropriate to situations where more than two categories have to be compared, e .g., the crop yield
from several varieties of seeds, the fuel efficiency of several brands of cars, the
attitude of persons belonging to various religions on family planning, and the like.
</p>

 <p>
	  The ANOVA is designed to test whether a significant difference exists among the three or more
simple means. In this analysis, the total variance in a set of data is divided into
variation within- groups, and variation between groups.
</p>

<p>
	 The ANOVA used for studying the differences among the influence of various categories of one
independent variable on a dependent variable is called one- way ANOVA, and that used for studying
influence of two independent variables on a dependent variable is called two- way
ANOVA.
</p>

<p>
	 The ANOVA technique is based on the concept of sum of squared deviations from a mean.
corresponding to the total variance and its two components, we have the total sum of
squares (SS),
between- groups sum of squares (83b), and vvilhin- groups sum of squares (SSW).
</p>

	Suppose we want to determine the influence of religious affiliation on child

</p>

<p>
	Assume we had interviewed four women in each religious category and obtained
scores (ranging from 1 to 5).
</p>

 <p>
   The within-groups sum of squares (SSW) is obtained by combining the sums of squares (i. e., The squared deviations of every raw score from its sample mean).
</p>

<p>
	The between-groups sum of squares (SSb) is obtained as under: Calculate the difference
between each sample mean and the total mean. Square this difference. Multiply it by the size in the concerned category and add these quantities.
</p>
<pagenum page="normal" id="page000360">360</pagenum>

  <h1>

<p>
The total sum of squares (sst) is equal to a sum of within and between groups sum of squares
</p>

<h1>
	Simple Formulas
</h1>

 The computation of sums of squares using the above formula is a time-consuming and
tedious process. The following simple formula may be used:


<p>
  Mean square: The value of the sums of squares tends to become larger as variation increases
and also as sample size increases. Therefore, the sum of squares cannot be regarded as a satisfactory
‘pure’ measure of variation, unless it is controlled for the sample size. This is
achieved by a measure of variation called the mean square (or variance) that is
obtained by dividing SSb or SSw by the appropriate degrees of freedom:

        MSb =SSb/dfb

        Msw = SSW/dfw

where  MSb = the between-groups mean squares

       MSW = the within-group mean squares

df = the degrees of freedom.

The degrees of freedom are obtained by:
dfb = k — 1

dfW = nt — k

</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000361">361</pagenum>

 <h1>
	  page no:361
</h1>

Where k = the number of samples (groups)

nt = the total number of scores in all samples combined

For the data from Table 11.21, the degrees of freedom work out to

dfb = 4 — 1 = 3
df = 16 — 4 = 12

We get the mean squares:

MSb = .50/3 = 0.17
MSw =  65/12= 0.54

<p>
	The F-ratio: The analysis of variance yields an F ratio that is a ratio between groups Variation
and within —groups variation. The F ratio indicates the size of the difference between groups  relative to the size of the variation within each group.

  For Table 11.21, F: MSbw/MSw =0.17/0. 54=0.31
</p>

<p>
Having obtained an F ratio, we must now determine whether it is larger enough to reject the null
hypothesis. If the calculated F ratio is larger than the corresponding table value, the null hypothesis
is rejected and the research hypothesis is supported. If the calculated F ratio is less than the table
value, the null hypothesis is accepted. For the data in Table 11.21 the table value of F for degrees
of freedom of 3 and 12 respectively at 0.05 level of significance is 3. 49. As the calculated Value is
only 0. 31, the null hypothesis is accepted Thus, we can conclude based on the data 1n Table 11.12
that there is no difference in child health care awareness among women of different religious groups.

independent variables are described in advanced texts such as Edwards, Allen L. Statistical Analysis,

<h1>
	Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA)
</h1>

<p>
	This analysis is an extension of bivariate ANOVA, in which the ratio of among -group variance
to within -group variance is calculated on a set of variables instead of on a single variable.  This
analysis is useful for a study involving several. metric dependent variables along with many non- metric explanatory variables. It is specially applied when a researcher wants to test hypotheses
concerning multivariate differences in group responses to experimental manipulations e ..g, use a
MANOVA in an experiment using one test market and one control market to examine the effect of
an advertising campaign on sales as well as on awareness, knowledge and attitudes.

Analysis of Covariance (ANOCOVA),  page no:362
</h1>

 <p>
	 This analysis is used as a procedure for the statistical control of an uncontrolled variable in an
experiment. The influence of the uncontrolled variable is usually removed by simple linear regression
method and the residual sums of squares are used to provide variance estimates. In other words, from
each individual score is subtracted the portion of that score which is predictable
from uncontrollable  variable. Then the usual analysis of variance is made on the
resulting scores.

 <p>
	 Rangaswamy, Ramasamy and Guruswami (1972),51 in their study of adoption of new technology
in agriculture used ANOVA to study whether small (0-5 acres), medium (5-10) and large (above 10
acres) farmers differ in average adoption and computed F value for testing the
significance (.01 level). The result showed that the groups differed signiﬁcantly in
average adoption.
</p>

 <p>
	 They also made similar ANOVA analysis for studying differences in adoption among different
groups of farmers classified according to (a) their tenurial status, (b) credit scores, (c) yield scores, (d)ducational status, and (e) training in new technology.

	  Gautam and Narayan (1985),52 in their case study on organizational effectiveness in a public
sector enterprise, used one-way ANOVA to test the null hypothesis: The differences in mean satisfaction
scores were due to chance. The responses of executives relating to (1) Pay, (2) Promotion avenues,
(3) Working conditions, (4) Team work, (5) Autonomy and (6) Recognition for good work were
Considered. Two independent estimates of the common variance were made: first is a
weighted average of the variances within each of the separate samples based on executive levels; and the
second is the variance of the separate sample means, treated as individual scores. The calculated F- value
 of 4.15 was significant at .05 level, leading to rejection of Ho- A similar ANOVA analysis was
also made to test the H0 relating to workers’ satisfaction with salary, hours of work, team work, etc. In this case also the obtained F- value was significant at .05
level.

  Pappuraj (1986)54 tested the null hypothesis that there is no significant variation between the
executives’ opinions, the firm’s current philosophy and the suggested level of responsiveness towards

towards (1) customers, and (2) the society at large.

supervisors in perceiving each organizational climate dimension. The supervisors’ scores on the
various OC dimensions (scope for advancement, grievance handling, participative management,
recognition and appreciation, etc.) were used for the analysis. For each of the nine dimensions of OC,
between- -company mean square was substantially larger than within- -company mean square, and F-
ratio was statistically significant (p .001) in each case. Thus for the sample as a whole there was
adequate inter- rater agreement in perceiving each climate dimension. He also used a similar ANOVA
analysis for examining the inter- rater agreement in the assessment of supervisor -management relations.

multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) on relative weights associated with six barriers (cost
advantages of incumbents, product differentiation of incumbents, customer switching costs, access to
distribution channels, government policy) for four decisions (early entry and late
entry in consumer goods market and industrial goods markets).

	                11.6 HYPOTHESIS TESTING
</h1>

<p>
	The meaning, characteristics, types and functions of hypotheses have been discussed in Section
5.4 of Chapter 5, above. Hypotheses are tentative propositions relating to the phenomenon under
study. They have to be tested empirically before we can accept or reject them. The
various aspects of testing hypotheses are discussed in this Section.
</p>

<h1>
	Meaning
</h1>

<p>
	Hypothesis testing means subjecting a hypothesis to an appropriate empirical scrutiny and
statistical test to determine its validity. A researcher has to do a number of things as pre-requirements.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000364">364</pagenum>

<p>
	for testing a hypothesis. He should see that the hypothesis is testable, i.e., amenable for empirical
Investigation. The variables used in the hypothesis should be amenable to measurement. The researcher
has to establish decision rules pertaining to the level of significance and specify the type of sampling
distribution to be used. He has then to select a real social situation that will be sufficient as a
reasonable testing ground for the hypothesis. For example, if the hypothesis is concerned with consumer
behaviour, the researcher should select a sample of consumers, and collect the relevant data needed
for verifying his hypothesis, and analyze them. All these are pre-requirements for hypothesis testing.
</p>

<h1>
	Testing Approaches
</h1>

<p>
	There are two approaches to hypothesis testing. They are: (1) the classical or sampling theory
approach, and the Bayesian approach. The classical approach is an established one and is widely used
in research. In this approach, the decision- making rests totally upon an analysis of sampling data. A hypothesis is set up and tested on the basis of sample data.
</p>

<p>
	The Bayesian Approach is based on an older theorem known as Bayes Theorem. It also uses
sampling data, but it goes beyond them, and takes into consideration all other available information
for making decisions. Most of the additional information consists of subjective probability estimates
about the various states of nature. Decision rules are established, and cost and other estimates are
made. The expected outcomes of combinations of these elements are made. On the basis of them,
decision alternatiVes are judged. The Bayesian approach has emerged as an alternative testing procedure
since the mid-1950s. It is likely to gain a significant place in applied statistical
inference, but its acceptance in research practice has been slow.
</p>

<h1>
	The Logic or Hypothesis Testing
</h1>

<p>
	 Our first task is to state the hypothesis in statistical terms. Suppose we are studying the impact
of a rural employment scheme on the level of income of rural people. The hypothesis may be stated
as the average level of income of rural people has increased due to the employment scheme. We draw
a random sample of rural people in the villages covered by the scheme and collect
income data for testing the hypothesis.
</p>

<p>
	We develop a null hypothesis (Ho) for statistically testing the hypothesis. The null
hypothesis .specifically formulated for testing for possible rejection or nullification. Hence the name null
hypothesis. It is accompanied by an alternative hypothesis (Ha), i.e., our regular research hypothesis
which is the logical opposite of the null hypothesis. Let us state the null hypothesis as: the
implementation of the employment scheme has not led to an increase in the average rural income level.
</p>


<p>
	The null hypothesis is always a statement of no change or no difference or no relationship. Both
the null hypothesis and the research hypothesis are expressed in terms of the population parameters,
not in terms of the sample statistics. It is the null hypothesis that is tested
directly; the research hypothesis is supported when the null hypothesis is rejected.
</p>

<p>
	The need for a null hypothesis arises out of a logical necessity. The null hypothesis is based on
a negative inference in order to avoid the fallacy of affirming the consequent. That
is, it is easy to reject a false hypothesis rather than to accept a real hypothesis.
</p>

<p>
	Since a sample is likely to vary somewhat from its population, the sample result is subject to
sampling error and therefore, it does not always reflect the true population value. Accordingly, the
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000365">365</pagenum>

 <h1>
	page no:365
</h1>

<p>
	sample result cannot be interpreted directly; a decision rule is needed to enable us to reject or accept
a hypothesis on the basis of a sample result. We should determine whether the sample
result falls within a range that can occur by chance or could not possibly by a result
of chance.
</p>

<h1>
	Significance levels
</h1>

<p>
  When does the sample result justify the rejection of the null hypothesis? The answer is: when
it could not be a result of chance, i. e., when it is highly improbable. Statisticians generally consider
that an event is statistically improbable, only if it is among the extreme 5 per cent or 1 per cent of
the possible outcomes. The 5 per cent (or 1 per cent) value defines the proportion of a sampling
distribution59 that contains the specified highly improbable outcomes. This proportion of the distribution
is called the region of rejection, and the 5 per cent (.05) and l per cent (0.01) are called the levels
of significance or levels of confidence. (See exhibit 11.4). These are levels of probability at which
the null hypothesis can be rejected with confidence. For example, 0.05 level of significance means
that we are willing to reject the Ho, if the sample statistic occurs by chance only 5
times or less out of 100 times. The significance levels commonly used are .001, .01, and .05.
</p>

<p>

Thus, the decision rule is specified in terms of a specific level of significance. If the obtained
sample result falls within the specified region of rejection, the null hypothesis is
rejected at that level of significance. The rejection of the null hypothesis supports
the research hypothesis.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000366">366</pagenum>

<h1>
   Type I and Type II Errors, page no:366
</h1>

<p>
	 In statistical hypothesis testing as the entire population is not measured directly, the statistical
test can never prove whether the null hypOthesis is really/ actually true or false. The only thing it
shows is whether the sample result is sufficiently likely or unlikely to justify the decision based on
the sample evidence to reject or not to reject the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis can be actually
true or false. If a null hypothesis which is actually true is rejected, the decision based on the sample
evidence is wrong. Such an error is called a Type I error. If the null hypothesis is
false but is not rejected, then the error is called a Type II error
</p>

<h1>
	Interpreting the Significance Level
</h1>

<p>
	   The probability of rejecting a true hypothesis — a type I error — is equivalent to the level of
significance. Thus, a researcher employing the 5% level of significance has 5% probability of falsely
rejecting the true null hypothesis. Exhibit 11.6 illustrates how to interpret a 5% level of significance.
Note that 2.5 of the area under the normal curve is located in each tail. 95% of the area under the
normal curve is covered by an interval extending 1.96 standard deviation on either side of the mean.
(This is valid for the normal distribution). In this area there is no significant difference between the
sample statistic and the population parameter. Hence, in this area we would accept the null hypothesis.
In the remaining 5% area, a significant difference between them exists and so here we would reject
The null hypothesis. Even if the Sample statistic falls in the non shaded region, it
does not prove that the Ho is true, it simply does not provide statistical evidence to
reject it.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000367">367</pagenum>

<h1>
	  page no:367
</h1>

 <p>
	  The higher the significance level, the higher the probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis
Therefore to minimize the probability of rejecting a true hypothesis, the significance level should be as low as possible.
</p>

 <p>
	 The choice of significance level is determined by the type of problem under study and the
consequence of rejecting a true hypothesis or retaining a false one. If the practical implication of
rejecting a true hypothesis are more severe than those of retaining a false one, it would be preferable
to minimize the significance level to say 0.01 or ..001 When a study does not have
practical implications, the choice of level will usually be governed by accepted
conventions.
</p>

<h1>
	One- tailed and Two- tailed Tests
</h1>

<p>
	A statistical test used for hypothesis testing may be one- -tailed or two- tailed. In an one-tailed
test, the region of rejection is located at either the left or the right tail of the sampling distribution
In a two tailed test, the region of rejection is located at both the left and right tails
i. e., a two- tailed test will reject the null hypothesis if the sample mean is significantly higher than or
lower than the hypothesized population mean. Suppose a manufacturer of light bulbs wants to produce
bulbs with a mean life of 1,200 hours. If the lifetime lS shorter, the cost of production were increases. So,
the manufacturer does not want to deviate significantly from 1,200 hours in either direction. A sample
of output can be tested for the null hypothesis, H0 =1 ,200 and may use a two- tailed test. Ho is
rejected if the mean life of bulbs in the sample is either too far above 1,200 hours
or too far 1,200 hours.
</p>

<p>
	 The decision to locate the region of rejection in one or two tails will depend upon whether the
research hypothesis (Ha ) implies a specific direction to the predicted results and whether it specifies
large or small values. When Ha predicts large values, the’ region of rejection will be located at the
right tail of the sample distribution. When Ha implies lower values, the left tail is
selected.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000368">368</pagenum>

 <h1>
	 page no:368
</h1>

<p>
	  A research hypothesis, which indicates a direction of difference (higher or lower) rather than the
mere existence of a difference, is a directional hypothesis, example, educated couples have a lower
number of children than that of the general population. A directional hypothesis requires the use of
non -tailed test. When the direction of the research hypothesis cannot be predicted,
the two -tailed test is used.
</p>

<h1>
	 Degrees or Freedom
</h1>

<p>
	    This is another concept relating to hypothesis testing. The degree of freedom in a distribution
is  the number of observations or values that are independent of each other, and cannot be deduced
from each other, i. e., the number of values which we can choose freely. When a mean is computed
from a number of values, there are no restrictions placed on the data. The sum is calculated and
divided by n. However, when we compute a standard deviation, one restriction is imposed, viz., the
sum of the deviations from the mean must be zero. This restriction uses up one degree
of freedom and so the denominator of the formula is n-l, rather than n.
</p>

<p>
	Suppose we have two values ‘a’ and ‘b’ and we know their mean is 15. What values ‘a’ and
‘b’ can take on in this situation? They can be any two values whose sum is" 30, because 30 -:- 2 =
15.Suppose we find that ‘a’ has a value of 9. Now ‘b’ is no longer free to take on any value, but
must have the value of 21(30—9) only. In this distribution of two values with a given
mean, we are free to specify only one of the values. Thus, we have one degree of
freedom.
</p>

<p>
	Suppose there are six values in a sample with a mean of 18. In this case the degree of freedom
of the number of values we can specify freely, are 6 — 1 = 5. We are free to give any values to five
observations, and the value of the sixth one is determined automatically. To
generalize, if the sample size is n, If is n, then the degree of freedom is n — 1.
</p>

<p>
	   The strength of prediction of a population parameter from a sample statistic is
increased, as the number of independent observations or the degree of freedom is
increased.
</p>

<h1>
	Statistical Testing Procedure
</h1>

<p>
	The statistical testing of a hypothesis consists of the following steps:

1. State the null hypothesis and the (alternative) research hypothesis. The hypotheses
   should be stated clearly, example,

H0: Educated and uneducated persons have the same level of political awareness.

Ha: Educated persons have higher level of political awareness than uneducated persons.

2. Select the appropriate statistical test. There are various tests of significance
   such as ‘t’-
   test, z-test, chi-squire test, etc. (See the next Section 11.7 for a detailed
    description of test
   of significance). An appropriate test must be selected with reference to the nature of the
   population studied, the method of sampling used, the level of measurement of data
   and the  like. This problem of test selection will also be discussed in Section 1.7
   , below.

 3. Select the desired level of significance. The most common level is .05; .01 is also widely  used. The exact level to choose is largely determined by how much a risk of Type-I Error we are willing to accept, and the effect that this choice has on the risk of committing the Type-II Error.

<p>
	4. Compute the appropriate statistic from the sample data. A random sample has to be
selected as per the sample design decided, and for the collected data, the appropriate static
or measure (e. g., mean, standard deviation or correlation) with reference to the research
question, type of hypothesis to be tested and the level of measurement of the data.
(See Sections 112,11. 3 and 11.,4 above).
</p>

<p>
	5. Select the correct type of probability distribution. The probability distribution are
theoretical distributions that describe how outcomes are expected to vary. They are different
from frequency distributions. While a frequency distribution is a listing of the
frequencies of all the actual outcomes occurred, a probability distribution IS a listing of the
probabilities of all the possible anticipated outcomes. Probability distribution are
mathematically derived and can be based on theoretical considerations (the tosses of a coin
or on subjective estimates or on experience. Since these distributions deal with
expectations, they are useful models in making inferences and decisions under
conditions of uncertainty.
</p>


 <p>
	 In hypothesis testing, generally the choice is between the normal distribution and the
"t distribution. The normal distribution is a theoretical or ideal model. As described
Section 6.4 of Chapter 6 - Sampling, above, the normal distribution is unimodal and
symmetrical. The total area under the normal curve contains 100 per cent of values in the
given distribution, and approximately 99.7 per cent of all the values in a normally
distributed population lie within 3 standard deviations on either side from the mean.

The ‘t’ distribution is based on theoretical work done by W. S. Gossett (pen name ‘student’
The‘ t’ distribution 15 flatter than the normal distribution, and there is a different ‘t’ distribution
for every possible sample size. As the sample size gets larger, the shape of the t distribution
loses its flatness, and approximately equal to the normal distribution. In fact, for sample
sizes of more than 30, the "t distribution is so close to the normal distribution. Therefore
the normal distribution is the appropriate probability distribution when the sample size in
larger than 30. The use of t- distribution is appropriate when the sample size is 30 or less
and the population standard deviation is not known It is also necessary to Use the finite
population multiplier (see Section 6. 4 of Chapter 6, above) whenever the population is finite
in size, sampling is done without replacement, and the sample is more than 5 per cent
of the population.
</p>

<p>
	6. Compute the significance test value. After the sample statistic is calculated, the formula
for the selected significance test is used to obtain the calculated test value (t, r
other measure, as the case may be).
</p>

<p>
	7. Obtain the critical test value. We must loCate the critical value in the Table Concerned
with the selected probability distribution (normal or t) for the given leVel of
significance for
the appropriate number 6f degrees of freedom. The critical value so located in the
table is commonly known as Table value.
</p>

<p>
	8. Make the decision. For most tests, if the calculated test value in larger than the concerned for
critical (i. e., table) value, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the
research hypothesis is supported. If the table value is larger than the calculated
value, the hypothesis is not supported. (See example given in the next Section).

<h1>
11.7 TESTS OF SIGNIFICANCE, The Parametric Tests, Page no:370
</h1>

<p>
 The tests of significance used for hypothesis testing are of two types: the parametric and non-
parametric tests. The parametric tests are more powerful, but they depend on the parameters or
characteristics of the population. They are based on the following assumptions:

1. The observations or values must be independent, i.e., the selection of one item must not
depend upon the selection of any other item.

2. The population from which the sample is drawn on a random basis should be normally
distributed.

3. The population should have equal variances.

4. The data should be measured at least at interval level so that arithmetic operations can be
used.

 The important parametric tests are: the z—test, the t—test and the F—test.
</p>

<h1>
    The z-test
</h1>

<p>
 Prof. R. A. Fisher has developed the z— test. It is based on the normal distribution, it is widely
used for testing the significance of several statistics such as mean, median, mode, coefficient of
correlation and others. This test is used even when binomial distribution or 't' distribution is applicable
on the presumption that such a distribution tends to approximate normal distribution as the sample
size (n) becomes larger.
</p>

<p>
The relevant test statistic, z, is calculated and compared with its probable value (to be read  from
the normal distribution table) at a specified level of significance for judging the significance of the
measure concerned.
 </p>

<p>
For Formulas, see “Applications of the Tests of Significance” ,below.
</p>

<h1>
    Research Example
</h1>

<p>
 Rama Kapur60 in her study on Role conflict among employed housewives computed Z values
pertaining to the differences between mother role and other sub roles of housewives (overall) and also
for each occupational group. The Z values showed that respondents experienced difficulty in their role
as mothers and also in their relationship with parents and relatives.
 </p>

<h1>
 The t -test
</h1>

<p>
The t-test was developed by W.S. Gosset around 1915. Since he published his finding under a
pen name ‘Student’, it is known as Student’s t-test. It is suitable for testing the significance of a
simple mean or for judging the  significance of difference between the means of two samples, when
the samples are less than 30 in number and when the population variance is not known. When two
samples are related, the paired t-test is used. The t-test can also be used for testing the significance
of the coefficients of simple and partial correlations.
 </p>

<p>
 The relevant test statistic, t, is calculated from the sample data, and it is compared with its
corresponding critical value in the t-distribution table for rejecting or accepting a null hypothesis.
For formula, see “Applications of the Tests of Significance”. below.   </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000371">371</pagenum>
<h1>
Research Examples, Page no:371
</h1>

<p>
Krishnaswami and Seshaiah (1985)61 used t-test to examine the significance of linear and
compound growth rates of branch expansion of banks in India in the post- nationalisation period, and
also that of linear and compound growth rates of deposits and advances of banks and found them
significant at .01 level.
 </p>

<p>
Rajkishor Panda (1986)62 in his study on the use of water in a canal irrigation system in Puri
district, Orissa, tested the significance of differences in yield - rate of selected crops among farm size yield rate
differences significant. The yield rates were higher for the small farms than those for the large farms.
</p>

<h1>
 The F-test
</h1>

<p>
The F-test is based on F- distribution (which is a distribution skewed to the right, and tends to
be more symmetrical, as the number of degrees of freedom in the numerator and denominator increases).
The F- test is used to compare the variances of two independent samples. It is also used in analysis
of variance (ANOVA) for testing the significance of more than two sample means at a time. It is also
used for judging the significance of multiple correlation coefficients. (See Section 11.5,above).
</p>

<h1>
    Research Examples
</h1>

<p>
    See under ANOVA in Section 11.5 above.
 </p>

<h1>
    The Nonparametric Tests
</h1>

<p>
The non-parametric tests are population - free tests, as they are not based on the Characteristics
of population. They do not specify normally distributed populations or equal variances. They are easy
to understand and to use. The non- parametric tests are the only ones usable with nominal data; they
are also the most appropriate technically correct tests to use with ordinal data.
 </p>

<p>
To understand the important place of non- parametric tests in social science research, we must
understand the statistical concept of power. The power of a test is the probability of rejecting the null
hypothesis when it is actually false and should be rejected. The power varies from one test to another .
The most powerful tests are the tests that have the most rigorous requirements to satisfy. These are
parametric tests. Hence, social researchers would ideally prefer to use parametric tests of significance.
However, it is often not possible to satisfy their requirements, because much of the data of social
science research are at the ordinal or nominal level, and we cannot be sure of the normal distribution
of the properties under study.
 </p>

<p>
When the requirements of a test are not met, it is not possible to know the power of the test.
Under such circumstances, the non-parametric tests are relevant and hence their importance in social
science research.
 </p>

<p>
The important non-parametric tests are: the chi -square test, the Median test, the Mann -Whitney
U test, the sign test, the Wilcoxin matched -pairs test (or signed ranks test), and Kolmogorow  Smirnov
(KS) test.

<h1>
The Chi-square Test (X^2)
</h1>

<p>
  The Chi-square test is the most popular non—parametric test of significance in social science
research. It is used to make comparisons between two or more nominal variables. Unlike the other
tests of significance, the chi-square is used to make comparisons between frequencies rather than
between mean scores. This test evaluated whether the difference between the observed frequencies
and the expected frequencies under the null hypothesis can be attributed to chance or actual population
differences. A chi-square value is obtained by the formula:
</p>

<p>
Suppose we want to examine the relationship between education and income and the frequency
data obtained are summarized in Table 11.23.

                                    TABLE 11.23
                        Distribution of Income by Education
Income                               Education
                               Low      High                   Total
Low                            30        12                     42
High                           10        28                     38
Total                          40        4O                     80
</p>

<p>
Null Hypothesis: There is no difference between the two education categories in their pattern
income level. (That is, persons with low education and persons with high education are expected
to have the same proportion of low or high income level).
 </p>

<p>
Research Hypothesis: There is a relation between educational and income levels.
q, We can compute the expected frequencies with the observed ones. The greater the differences
tween them, the larger will be the value of X^2.

To compute the expected frequency for any cell, the following formula is used:

       fc = (row total) (column total)
             ________________________
              n(total number)
 </p>

<p>
The expected frequencies so computed are shown in brackets in Table 11.24.
                            TABLE 11.24
       Income by Education: Observed and Expected Frequencies
Income                                 Education

Low                      30 (21)     12 (21)                 42

<p>
To compute )8, the expected frequency of each cell is subtracted from the observe
squared, divided by the expected frequency of the cell and then all quotients are added up.

X^2  =  (30—21)^2 +(12—21)^2 +(10-19)^2 +(28—19)^2
      ________  __________   ________  ________
         21          21        19        19

   =  81 + 81 + 81 + 81
    _____  ___  ___  ___
     21     21   19   19
  = 3.86 + 3.86 + 4.26 + 4.26 = 16.24.
  = 16.24
  </p>

<p>
To evaluate the obtained X^2 value (16.24), we have to compare it to the critical value of
sampling distribution of X^2 and to find whether the value of 16.24 is large enough to reject the null
hypothesis. The sampling distribution of x^2 is determined by (1) the level of significance and(2) the
number of degrees of freedom.  </p>
<p>
Let us select for the problem under illustration a level of significance of .01, which means that
only if the calculated X^2 is larger than what would be expected in not more than 1 out of 100 samples,
will the null hypothesis be rejected.  </p>
<p>
The number of degrees of freedom of the x^2 distribution IS set by the number of cells for which
the expected frequencies can be selected freely. For any bivariate table, the cells that can be determined
freely are limited by the marginal total of both variables. Thus in a 2 x 2 table, there is only one cell
that is free to vary, the three others being predetermined by the marginal total. 63 The formula used
is :   </p>
<p>
   df = (r-1) x (c-1)
Where r = the number of rows
      c = number of columns
Thus in a 2 x 2 table df = (2-1)(2-1) =1.
In a 3x3 table df = (3-1) (3—1) =4 and so on.   </p>
<p>
For our example, with 1 degree of freedom and 0.01 level of significance the table value of X^2
is 6.635. Our obtained x^2 value (16.24) is much larger than the table value. Hence, the null hypothesis
is rejected and the research hypothesis is supported i.e., we may conclude that there is significant
relationship between education and income.   </p>

<h1> Yate’ s correction </h1>
<p>
If the expected frequency is less than 10 (but not below 5) in any one cell of a 2 x 2 table, the
x^2 formula may yield an inflated chi -square value. In order to reduce the overestimate, a correction
known as Yate’ s correction is applied. This correction is the difference between each set of obtained  and expected frequencies is reduced by 0.50.  </p>
<p>
The important requirements for using the chi -square as a test of significance are:
1. There should be at least a 2 x 2 table
2. The data should be nominal i.e., frequencies only  </p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page000374">374</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:374
</h1>
<p>
3. The sample should have been selected on a random basis

4. For a 2 x 2 table, no expected frequency should be smaller than 5. Yate’s correction formula
should be used for a 2 x 2 table in which an expected cell frequency is smaller than 10.
For a comparison of three or more categories in each variable (i. e., 3 x 3 or 4 x 5 etc.) there
is no hard and fast rule regarding the minimum cell frequencies.
</p>

<p>
Evaluation: The x^2 test compares frequencies only, not ordinal, interval data, or other forms of
data. The  x^2  statistic does not lend itself to comparison with other statistics and unless the values of
n are equal, even two chi -square values cannot meaningfully be compared with each other, because
the value of x^2 is a function of n. </p>

<h1> The Median Test </h1>
<p>
The chi—square test is applicable to two or more independent samples measured at the nominal
level. For ordinal data also, the median test is useful. It determines the significance of the difference
between the medians of two or more random samples. It is meant for determining whether the samples
have been taken from populations with the same median The median test compares the medians. The
procedure for computing the median of two or more samples is as follows. </p>
<p>
1. Find the median of the two or more samples combined.
2. Count the number of values in each sample falling above the combined median and items
that are not above the median and prepare a contingent table
3. Perform a chi-square test for the ‘above median’ cases and ‘not above median’ cases so
counted
4. Determine the degrees of freedom.
5. Compare the calculated x^2 value with the corresponding table value of x^2 at the specified
degrees of freedom at the specified level of significance.
6. Make the decision.

If the calculated value equals or exceeds the table value we can reject the null hypothesis </p>

<h1>
The Mann-Whitney U Test, Page no:376
</h1>
<p>
This test belongs to a family of rank sum tests. It uses ranking information rather than pluses
and minuses and therefore, is more powerful than the median test. The U test is designed to determine
whether two independent samples have been drawn from the same population or from two different
populations having the same distribution. </p>
<p>
To apply the U test to a set of two samples (example, the average grades of students at two
colleges of a university), the values of the combined samples n1 and n2 are ranked from the lowest
to the highest rank irrespective of the samples, rank 1 to the lowest score, rank 2 to the next in order
and so on indicating beside each the identification of the sample. Then the ranks of each sample group
are summed separately and the sums are represented as R1 and R2. Then the value of U statistic is
computed using the formula given below:

     U   =  n1 X n2 + n1 (n1 +n2) -R1
                      _________
                          2

Where n1 = the number of items in sample 1
      n2 = the number of items in sample 2
      R1 = the sum of ranks of the items in sample 1
 </p>
<p>

If the null hypothesis that the n1 +n2 observations came from identical populations is true, then
the U statistic has a sampling distribution with a mean of:  </p>

<h1> The Sign Test </h1>
<p>
The sign test is one of the earliest non—parametric tests. Its name comes from the fact that it is
based on the direction (plus or minus signs) of a pair of observations and not their numerical
magnitude. It is useful for evaluating the effectiveness of two types of methods whose effects cannot
be quantified but can only be judged as superior/inferior or good/bad or preferable/not preferable,
example, evaluation of two types of teaching methods by a set of students. The evaluation of the two
methods are converted into signs: a plus means preference for the first method, a minus means
preference for the second method and a zero represents a tie (no preference). We count (+) signs and
(—) signs and exclude tie evaluations

H0: There is no difference between the two methods.

Ha: There is difference between the two methods.

<p>
Using the Z critical value of the normal distribution, the H0 is tested. The following formula is
used. </p>

<h1> The Wilcoxon Matched-pair Test (Signed Rank Test) </h1>

This test not only tests the direction, but also the magnitude of differences between matched
pairs (example, husband and wife, twins, output of two similar machines, or the results of a before-
after experiment).
<p>
The procedure of calculation is as follows:

1. Find the difference (d) between each pairs of scores.

2. Rank the d’s without regard to sign, giving a rank 1 to the smallest difference, 2 to the next
in order and so on.

3. Then to each rank affix sign of difference.

4. Total the ranks with plus signs and total the ranks with minus signs.

The pairs whose scores are equal are dropped from the calculation. When two or more pairs
have the same d value, their ranks are averaged. The sum of the ranks of the smaller sign group is
designated as T.  </p>

<h1>  Kolmogorov Smirnov Test (KS Test)  </h1>

is more powerful than the x2 test and can be used for very small samples when the X^2 test cannot be
applied. The KS test is a test of goodness -of- fit in which we specify the cumulative frequency
distribution which would occur under the theoretical distribution and compare that with the observed
cumulative frequency distribution. The theoretical distribution represents our expectations under Ho.
The point of greatest divergence between the observed and the theoretical distribution is determined
and this value is identified as D (maximum deviation). The value for D is calculated as follows:

         D = maximum | Fo(X) — Ft (X) |                                         ... (11.62)

where Fo(X) = the observed cumulative distribution of a random sample of n observations where
              X is any possible score.
             Fo(X) = k/n, where X is any possible score,
      Ft(X) = the theoretical frequency distribution specified under Ho.

The calculated D value is compared with the table D value and decision on significance is made.  </p>
<h1> Other non-parametric Tests </h1>
<p>
McNemar test is used when the data are nominal and related to two related samples.

When there are k related samples with nominal data, the Cochran Q test can be used.

When the data are at least ordinal, we may also use the Friedman two-way analysis of variance
test.

The details of calculation procedures for these tests are found in many books on Statistics. (see
Seigel, Non-parametric Statistics; or Hays W.L, Statistics for the Social Sciences). </p>

<h1> The Choice of a Significant Test </h1>
<p>
The selection of a particular significance test for the given case is determined by the following
criteria:

1. The power efficiency of the test: A more powerful test provides a given level of significance
with a smaller sample than with a less powerful test. Hence, the more powerful parametric tests are
preferable to non—parametric tests, provided the requirements of parametric tests are satisfied. However,
when those requirements are not met, the non-parametric tests have to be used.

2. The nature of the population: When the population is normally distributed and its variance
is known, the z-test is used, but when the population variance is unknown and the sample size is
small, the t—test is used.

3. The sampling method used: One of the requirements of parametric tests is that the sample
should have been drawn on a random basis. This requirement equally holds good in several non-
parametric tests also.

4. The number of samples involved: When the samples to be compared are two, the z-test, t-
test, or the U- test, depending on the nature of distribution and the sample size is used. When three
or more samples are to be compared the ANOVA test or x^2 test is used, depending on whether the
population is normally distributed or not.

5. The sample size: In the case of a small sample of less than 30, drawn from a normal
distribution, the t-test is used; and for larger samples, the z-test is used.

When the data are at least interval ones, the parametric tests are used. </p>

<h1>
 Applications or the Tests of Significance
 </h1>

<p>
The applications of appropriate significance tests in different research situations are explained
below:
</p>

<h1>
    1. Testing the Significance of a Mean
</h1>

<p>
  When a single sample is drawn from a particular population and some measure of central
tendency like mean is calculated, we wish to determine the statistical significance between the sample
mean and the population mean. There are different situations for such testing:

(i) Population normal, but infinite, sample size large or small but population variance known
the z- test is used,

(ii) Population normal and  finite sample size large or small but population variance known
 the z- test is used with finite population multplier.

(iii) Population normal and infinite, sample size small (n30) and population variance unknown
the t- test is used
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000380">380</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:380
</h1>

<p>
The nonparametric binomial test is used when the population is viewed as only two classes such
as male and female, buyer and nonbuyer etc., and the size of the sample is so small that the X^2  cannot
be used.  </p>

<p>
Where persons, events or objects are classified into two or more nominal categories and each
expected frequency is not less than 5 and when d — f = 1, the (non-parametric) X^2 test is used for
testing the significance of the sample mean.  </p>

<h1>
 2. Testing the Differences between Two Means
</h1>

<p>
    Many hypotheses in social science research involve a comparison between two populations. The
difference between them may be studied by comparing their sample means. Does the obtained difference
between the two sample means represent a true difference between their populations' means? Examples
of such situations are: studies of output of male and female workers, the test performance of two
sections of students, the comparison of the test and control groups in an experiment, and the like.
(a) Two Independent Samples: When the means of two different samples (e. g., two samples
of employees, two samples of consumers, etc.) have to be compared, the following situations may
arise:

(i) Samples are larger (n  30)
The z— test is used for testing the difference between the means.
(ii) Samples are small (n 30)
The t- test is often used; the F— test can also be used.
(iii) When the requirements of parametric test are not met, and the data are at least ordinal
The Mann-Whitney U test is an alternative to t-test; the median test can also be used.
(iv) When data are nominal.
The X2 test is used.
(v) When data are ordinal the KS two-sample test is used.
</p>

<p>
(b) Two Related Samples: These are concerned with situations where the difference between
closely matched pairs such as husband and wife, experimental and control groups, etc. are studied.
The following situations may arise:

(i) Population normal and samples small
The paired t- test is used.

(ii) Observations nonmeasurable but judged as superior/inferior, etc. The sign test is used for
determining the direction of difference between the matched pairs. For determining both the
direction and magnitude of difference, the Wilcoxon Matched-pairs test is used.

(c) Three or more Independent Samples: We have often to test for significance in cases with
three or more independent samples.

The anlysis of variance is used to test the significance of the sample means when conditions are
appropriate for parametric tests. When the data of the samples are nominal the x^2 is the test of choice.
When the data are at least ordinal we can use Kruskal-Wallis test which is more powerful
an x^2.</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000381">381</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:381
</h1>

<p>
(d) Three or more related samples: When there are three or more matched samples (e.g., the
impact of three different trade discount rates on sales), a two—way ANOVA is employed with F- test
 </p>


<h1>
    Research Examples
 </h1>

<p>
Sarveswara Rao (1972)^69 used t- tests to test the significance of differences in means of dificiency
scores of clerks and supervisors in a job satisfaction study. These differences were in respect of seven
motivating factors (achievement, responsibility, etc.) and nine hygiene factors (salary, working
conditions, etc.). He also used t— tests for testing the significance of difference between mean of
motivators and mean of hygienes in respect of clerks and supervisors separately.
</p>

<p>
Rangaswamy, Ramasamy and Guruswami (1972)^70, in their study of factors influencing adoption
of improved agricultural practices by farmers in Coimbatore district, used to test the significance of
difference in average adoption scores between different farm-size holders, between owners and tenants,
between farms with adequate irrigation and farms with inadequate/average irrigation, between higher
and lower education groups, trained and untrained farmers, and between different value dimensions.
 </p>

<p>
Sharma (1987)^71 used t— test for comparing the mean scores of supervisor-management relations
and organisational climate between private sector and public sector enterprises.
</p>

<p>
Mohanasundaram (1988),^72 in his  study of the impact of minor irrigation scheme on Small
farmers, used t- tests to examine the significance of mean values of percentage of area under HYV
crops and percentage of area under cash crops to the total area cultivated before and after the
implementation of the irrigation scheme in the selected blocks.
</p>

<p>
Fern, Avila and Grewal (1989),^73 in their study on Salesforce turn-over, used t- test to test the
Significance of (a) mean differences in job satisfaction, (b) mean differences in role conflict and
ambiguity, and (C) mean differences in sales performance of thoSe Who stayed (n=162) and  those
who left (n=39).
 </p>

<h1>
    A Testing Proportions
 </h1>

<p>
(a) The significance of Proportions: In qualitative phenomena, we have data on the basis of
presence or absence of an attribute. With such data the sampling distribution may take the form of
binomial probability distribution. For example, the human resources director of a company may report
to the chairman that 70 per cent of the employees are ‘promotable’
</p>

<p>
A special committee assesses a sample of employees and finds only 60 per cent of the sample
are qualified for promotion.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000382">382</pagenum>

<h1>
Page no:382
</h1>

<p>
The significance of such proportions is tested by the use of z— test

 (b) Differences between Proportions: When two samples are drawn from two different
populations, one may wish to know whether the difference between their proportions is significant or
not. For example, the success of two different drugs developed for reducing blood pressure may be
tested by experiment.   </p>

<h1>
    Research Example
</h1>

<p>
Fern, Avila and Grewal (1989)^74 used X^2 -test for testing the significance of demographic
differences (age, marital status, education level, and life cycle stage) between those who left (n = 39)
and those who Stayed (n = 162), and for testing the differences in experience, company rating, job
security and sales performance between these two groups.
 </p>

<h1>
4. Testing Variances
 </h1>

<p>
(a) Comparing a Vriance to some hypothesized Population Variance: The X^2 test is used for
this purpose.
   </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000383">383</pagenum>

<h1>
Page no:383
</h1>

<p>
(b) Variances of two normal Populations: The equality of vaiances of two normal populations
is tested by the F -test.
</p>

<h1> 5. Testing Correlation Coefficients </h1>
<p>
When the correlation coefficient of two variables is computed on the basis of sample data, we
have to test the significance of the correlation coefficient. We use the following tests for the purpose:

(a) Simple Correlation Coefficient

(b) Partial Correlation Coefficient

(c) Multiple Correlation Coefficient

(d) Spearman’s Rank Correlation

When we compute this correlation coefficient for two variables, we have to test its significance
The testing device depends on the value of n. For small values of n (n  30), the table showing the
values for Spearman’s rank correlation to determine the acceptance and rejection regions may be used. </p>

<p>
If the sample size exceeds 30, then the sampling distribution of r is approximately normal, we
can then use the normal distribution table to find the appropriate z value for testing hypotheses about?
the population rank correlation and draw inference as usual. </p>

<h1>
 11.8 TIME SERIES ANALYSIS , Page no:384
</h1>
<p>
Time Series
    In economic and business research, researchers often obtain data relating to a phenomenon over
a time period. Such data are called a time series. A time series is a set of ordered observations of a
quantitative variable taken at successive points in time in terms of years, months, weeks, day or hours,
e.g., annual data of industrial production in a country, crop production data over a period of time,
weekly sales figures of a company, daily sales in a drug store, and the like.
</p>

<p>
A time series is influenced by a variety of forces which operate continuously, at recurring
intervals or at random. The data of the series are decomposed to study each of these influences in
isolation. This study is known as Time Series Analysis. This analysis identifies four kinds of change
or variation in the given phenomenon, viz., (1) secular trend (T), (2) cyclical fluctuation (C), (3)
seasonal variation (S), and (4) irregular variation (I).
</p>

<p>
Secular trend shows the direction of the series in a long-period of time. The trend is the long-
term movement of the series, reflecting either continuous growth, stagnation or decline. For example,
the cost of living index has been steadily increasing over the years.
</p>

<p>
Cyclical fluctuation refers to wave-like recurring rises and declines in an activity. The typical
example is the business cycle which moves through four phases: prosperity, recession, depression and
recovery.
</p>

<p>
Seasonal variation refers to recurring changes within a year e.g., fall in agricultural prices in
the harvest season, and rise in their prices in the off-season; increasing demand for electric fans and
air-cooling equipment in summer and declining demand for them in winter. The seasonal variation is
caused by changes in climatic conditions and social customs within a year.
</p>

<p>
Irregular Variation is a non-recurring unpredictable variation taking place at random. It stems
from several sources such as natural calamities, political developments, war and the like.
</p>

<p>
The combined influence of all the four components is often represented by a multiplicative
model-

Y = T x C x S x I or

an additive model——

Y = T + C + S + I

where Y = observed values of a time series T = Trend, C = cyclical fluctuation,
S = Seasonal variation, and I = Irregular variation.

The time series analysis aims at measuring each of these four kinds of variations. When one kind
of variation is measured, the other kinds are eliminated from the series.
</p>

<h1>
    Trend Analysis
 </h1>

<p>
Of the four kinds of variation in a time series, the secular trend represents its long-term direction.
The past trend may be used to evaluate the success or failure of a policy or program, and also to
predict the future patterns. A trend may be linear, curvilinear or straight line.
</p>

<p>
Methods or Measuring Trend: There are various methods of isolating the trend from the given
series, viz., the free hand method, semi-average method, moving average method and the method of
east squares. The last two methods are more important. They are described below.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000385">385</pagenum>

<h1>
Page no:385
</h1>
<p>
The Moving Average Method: This method of measuring trend is based upon the idea that if
the values of the series for a sufficient period of time are averaged, the influence of shorter -term
fluctuations will be eliminated. This is one of the methods aiming at elimination of seasonal variations.
A moving average is computed by adding the values for some number of years both before and after
to the value for the year for which the average is being Obtained, and then dividing the total value
by the total number of years included.
</p>

<p>
The period chosen for calculating moving averages should be long enough to eliminate the
effect of recurring variations in the series. This period should be identical with the length of the
cyclical movements in the data. Generally 3-year or 5-year period is taken to compute the moving
averages. When we calculate 3-yearly average, the first three years’ values are added, and their total
and average are noted against the second year. Next, we drop the first year’s value and add the next
three year's value and note the total and the average against the third year and so on. The averages
so calculated are plotted on a graph. The curve joining the points shows the rising or declining trend.
</p>

<p>
The moving average is appropriate for trend computation only when (1) the purpose of  the
investigation does not call for current analysis or forecasting, (2) the trend is linear, and (3) the
cyclical variations are regular both in periods and quantities.
</p>

<h1>
 Method of Least Squares
</h1>

<p>
This method is the most popular method of computing the secular trend in a time series. This
is used for fitting a line curve of best fit. (See Regression Analysis in Section 11.4, above). The least
squares method gives a formula for getting the straight line that will best fit the data. The equation
of a straight line is expressed as:
             Yc = a + bx                                                  ... (11.70)
where YC = the calculated value of the trend
a = the intercept of Y or the height of the line at the origin, i.e., when X== O, a = Y

b = the amount by which the slope of the tiend line rises or falls, i.e., the rate of increase
in Y for a unit change in X.

X = the number of units of time each given year lies away from the middle year of the
period </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000386">386</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:386
</h1>
<p>
(The middle of the time series is used as the origin for convenience in computation. If an even
number of year is given, the origin falls between the two middle years. Any other--- say first or last
--may also be used as the origin.)
</p>

<p>
Extrapolation of the Trend. The least squares method is objective and gives us the most
satisfactory results. The resultant equation is useful for forecasting further levels by extrapolation. For
example, the trend of production computed in Table 11.26 may be extended to 1993 by assigning X
the value of 10. When the equation Yc =13 + .75 (10) is solved, we get 20.5. Care must be taken

 </p>

<p>
in interpreting such a forecast. It is a forecast of trend only. First, actual values may be expected to
diverge from it because of cyclical and random factors. Second, the forecast has meaning, only if the
same basic influences which shaped the trend in the past can be expected to be operating in the future.
 </p>

<h1>
 Research Example
</h1>

<p>
Swarup and Sikker (1983)^75 used exponential equation for calculating compound growth rates
of area under cultivation, production and productivity for important crops keeping 1966-67 as the base
year in order to assess trends in area, production and productivity. The agricultural production is
determined by three factors, viz., area, yield and cropping pattern. In order lo determine the relative
contribution of each component to total production an additive model was used for this component
analysis.

12 REPORT WRITING , 12.1 INTRODUCTION, Page no:395
</h1>

<p>
 The final and a very important step in a research study is to write its report. The research report
is a means for communicating our research experiences to others and adding them to the fund of
knowledge. This chapter discusses the purpose of research reports, types of reports, planning report-
writing, research report format, principles of writing, drafting and finalising the report, and evaluation
of a research report.
</p>

<h1>
    Meaning and Purpose of a Research Report
</h1>

<p>
 A research report is a formal statement of the research process and its results. It narrates the
problem studied, methods used for studying it and the findings and conclusions of the study. </p>

The purpose of a research report is to communicate to interested persons the methodology and
the results of the study in such a manner as to enable them to understand the research process and
to determine the validity of the conclusions. The aim of the report is not to convince the reader of
the value of the result, but to convey to him what was done, Why it was done, arid What was its
outcome. It is so written that the reader himself can reach his own conclusions as to the adequacy of
the study and the validity of the reported results and conclusions.
</p>

<h1>
Characteristics of a Report
</h1>

<p>
A research report is a narrative but authoritative document on the outcome of a research effort.
It presents a highly specific information for a clearly designated audience. It is nonpersuasive as a
form of communication. Extra caution is shown in advocating a course of action even if the findings
point to it. Presentation is subordinated to the matter being presented. It is a simple, readable and
accurate form of communication.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000396">396</pagenum>

<h1>
Actions of a Research Report, Page no:396
</h1>

<p>
 A well written research report performs several functions.
1. It serves as a means for presenting the problem studied, methods and techniques used for
collecting and analysing data, the findings, conclusions and recommendations in an organised
manner.

2. It serves as a basic reference material for future use in developing research proposals in the
same or related area.

3. A report serves as a means for judging the quality of the completed research project.
4. It is a means for evaluating the researcher’s ability and competence to do research.

5. It provides factual base for formulating policies and strategies relating to the subject-matter
studied.

6. It provides systematic knowledge on problems and issues analysed.
 </p>

 <h1>
        12.2 TYPES OF REPORTS
</h1>

<p>
Research reports may be classified into (1) technical report, (b) popular report, (c) interim
report, (d) summary report, (e) research abstract, and (f) research article. These types of reports vary
from one another in terms of the degree of formality, physical form, scope, style and size.
 </p>

<h1>
    Technical Report/ Thesis
</h1>

<p>
This is a comprehensive full report of the research process and its outcome. It IS primarily meant
academic community, i.e., the scientists of the researcher’s discipline and other researchers. It is
normal long report covering all the aspects of the research process: a description of the problem
lied, the objectives of the study, methods and techniques used, a detailed account of sampling,
and other research procedures, sources of data, tools of data collection, methods of data process—
and analysis, detailed findings and conclusions and suggestions. There is also a technical appendix
methodological details, copies of measuring instruments and the like. It is so comprehensive and
complete that the study can be replicated by others.  </p>
<p>
The technical report is essentially technical in nature and scope and couched in technical
uage. It follows a specified pattern and consists of several prefatory sections with appropriate
lings and paragraphs. </p>

<h1>  Rular Report </h1>
<p>
This type of report is designed for an audience of executives/administrators and other non-
technical users. The requirement of this audience is different. The reader is less concerned with
nodological details, but more interested in studying quickly the major findings and conclusion. He
interested in applying the findings to decisions. </p>
<p>
The organization of this report is very important. The presentation can be more forceful and
masive without, of course, any distortion of fact. It should be clear, brief and straightforward.
complicated statistical techniques and tables need not be used. Instead pictorial devices may be
sively used. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000397">397</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:397
</h1>
<p>
The format of this report is different from that of a technical report. After a brief introduction
to the problem and the objectives of the study, an abstract of the findings, conclusions and recom
-mendations is presented. The methodological details, data analysis and their discussion are presented
in the second part. More headlines, underlining, pictures and graphs may be used. Sentences and
paragraphs should be short. There can be a liberal use of margins and blank space.  </p>
<p>
The style may be more journalistic but be precise and it should encourage rapid reading and
quick comprehension. </p>

<h1> Interim Report </h1>
<p>
When there IS a long time lag between data collection and the presentation of the results in the
case of a sponsored project, the study may lose its significance and usefulness and the sponsor may
also lose interest in it. One of the most effective ways to avoid such eventualities is to present an
interim report.  </p>
<p>
This short report may contain either the first results of the analysis or the final outcome of the
analysis of some aspect/s completely analysed. Whatever may be the coverage of the interim report,
it fulfills certain functions. It facilitates the sponsoring agency to take action without waiting for the
full report. It helps to keep alive the agency’s interest in the study and prevent misunderstandings
about the delay. In addition, it serves to spread over a longer period the time consuming process of
discussion of research findings and their implications. The report also enables the researcher to find
the appropriate style of reporting. </p>
<p>
The interim report contains a narration of what has been done so far and What were its outcome.
It presents a summary of the findings of that part of analysis which has been completed.  </p>

<h1> Summary Report </h1>
<p>
A summary report is generally prepared for the consumption of the lay audience, viz, the
general public. The preparation of this type of report is desirable for any study whose findings are
of general interest. It is written in non-technical, simple language with a liberal use of pictorial charts.
It just contains a brief reference to the objective of the study, its major findings and their implications
It is a short report of two or three pages. Its size is so limited as to be suitable for publication in daily
newspapers.  </p>

<h1> Research Abstract </h1>
<p>
This is a short summary of the technical report. It is usually prepared by a doctoral students
on the eve of submitting, his thesis. Its copies are sent by the University along with the letters of
request to the examiners invited to evaluate the thesis. It contains a brief presentation of the statement
of the problem, the objectives of the study, methods and techniques used and an overview of the
report. A brief summary of the results of the study may also be added. This abstract is primarily meant
for enabling the examiner -invitees to decide whether the study belongs to the area of their special
ization and interest. </p>

<h1> Research Article </h1>
<p>
This is designed for publication in a professional journal. If a study has two or more aspects
that can be discussed independently, it may be advisable to write separate articles rather than to crowd
too many things into a single article.   </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000398">398</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:398
</h1>
<p>
A research article must be clearly written in concise and unambiguous language. It must be
technically organised, progressing from a statement of the problem and the purpose of study, through
analysis of evidence, to the conclusions and implications. </p>
<p>
A professional journal may have its own special format for reporting research. It is important
and out in advance whether the publication does have specific format requirements. For example,
research articles submitted for publication in the Journal of Applied Psychology should be pre-
pared according to the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association. The preferred
that is: </p>
<p>
1. Introduction: A statement of the nature of the problem and a brief review of previous studies
ment to the development of the specific questions or hypotheses to be tested.

2. Method: A brief statement of what was done, where and how it was done, and a statement
the specific techniques and tools used.

3. Results: A presentation of the salient findings with tables or charts.

4. Discussion: A discussion of the findings in relation to the hypotheses or questions originally
ed.

5. Conclusion: A presentation of the contribution of the study to theory and/or practice and the
d implications of the findings. </p>
<p>
The article must be accompanied by an abstract of 100-150 words typed on a separate sheet of
er. </p>
<p>
Any reference to an article or other source is to be identified at an appropriate point in the text
the last name of the author, year of publication and pagination where appropriate, all within
hypotheses, e.g., Sherman (1980); Heller (1976, p.701). No footnote is to be used for purpose of
ion. </p>

<p>
Similarly, the Indian Society of Agricultural Economics, Bombay has prescribed guidelines for
mission of papers for publication in the Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics. The preferred
that is: 1. Introduction, 2. Methodology, 3. Results and Discussion; and 4. Policy implications/
inclusion, followed by references. Only cited works should be included in the reference list. The
of citations to be followed is: </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000399">399</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 399
</h1>
<p>
Regardless of the format followed, however, the style of writing should be the same as that us
for a technical report thesis. </p>

                   <h1>    12. 3 PLANNING REPORT WRITING

Steps in Planning Report Writing </h1>
<p>
After the data analysis is over, report writing cannot be started abruptly. It requires careful pt
planning. This planning process involves the following considerations and steps: </p>
<p>
As a research report is a means of communication, we have to consider some basic questions
which determine the effectiveness of communication, namely, ‘who’ says “what’ to ‘whom’ in ‘which
way’ and with ‘what effect.’ </p>
<p>
1. The Target Audience: The first step in planning report writing is to determine the target
audience. The form and style of reporting and other aspects depend upon the type of the reader,
whom the report is intended. The identification of the target audience depends on who is the
searcher and what is his intention. </p>
<p>
The target audiences, may be classified into (1) the academic (or scientific) community, (2)The
sponsors of research, and (3) the general public. </p>
<p>
The academic or scientific community will be the primary target audience in the folloWing cases
(1) when the research is undertaken as an academic exercise for a Master’s degree, or M.Phil Degree
Or Ph.D. degree (in this case the thesis evaluation committee members will be the immediate target
audience); (2) when a research student or Social scientist plans to publish his research output in
form of a research Monograph; (3) when a researcher plans to write research articles based on
research for publication in professional journals. (In the last two Cases, the referees, and the fellow
Scientists interested in the study will be the target audience). </p>
<p>
The Sponsors of Research may consist of two categories: (1) research promotion bodies I
Indian Council of Social Science ResearCh, the University Grants Commission, and education
foundations which provide financial support to social scientists working in universities and colleges
for undertaking research with a view to encouraging them to do research; and (2) government deport
ment, industrial and other organizations which sponsor research for their own use in policy makers
and the like. </p>
<p>
If the research is sponsored by a research promotion organization, the reporting has to follow
its prevalent norms. In general, a full -fledged technical report is expected, along with an abstract
the report. When the research is sponsored by an organisation for its own use, it has to be report
according to its requirements. It is to be written as a private documents, emphasizing the findings
recommendations rather than methodology. </p>
<p>
The general public is viewed as a cross-section of the society. This lay audience may
interested in the broad findings and the implications of research studies on socio-economic problems.
The reporting for this audience may be in the form of a summary report or an article written in
technical journalistic language.
</p>
<p>
Can one multipurpose report aiming at all categories of target audiences be written?
communication characteristics, viz., the level of knowledge and understanding, the information
and the kind of language to which one is accustomed, are not the same. They vary from one type
 </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000400">400</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:400
</h1>
<p>
audience to another. The preferences and the requirements of different audiences differ widely and
cannot be reconciled. Hence it is neither possible nor desirable to attempt to write one multipurpose
report. A separate report tailored to the needs of each type of audience has to be written when there
is a need for communicating to different types of audiences. </p>
<p>
2. The Communication Characteristics of the Audience: The second step in planning report
writing is to consider the selected audience’s communication characteristics. What is their level of
knowledge and understanding? What is the gap in knowledge on the subject between the readers and
the writer? The greater the knowledge gap, the more difficult it is to convey the full findings
meaningfully and concisely. </p>
<p>
What is the kind of language ——  scientific or journalistic —— that which the readers are accus-
tomed? What do they need to know about the study? Or, what is likely to be of interest to them? How
can the needed information be presented best — verbal, a combined tabular or pictorial presentation?
These questions determine the scope, form and style of reporting. The underlying purpose of a report
should be noted. The purpose of report is not communication with oneself, but communication with
the target audience. Hence we must constantly keep in mind the needs and requirements of the target
audience. </p>
<p>
3. The Intended Purpose of the Report: What is the intended purpose of the report? Is it meant
for evaluation by experts for the award of a degree or diploma? It is to be used as a reference material
by researchers and fellow scientists? Or it is meant for implementation by a user-Organization? This
intended purpose also determines the type of the report and its contents and form of presentation. </p>
<p>
4. The Type of Report: With reference to the intended use, the type of report to be prepared
should be determined. When the research is undertaken to fulfil the requirements of a degree or
diploma, or funded by a research promotion agency, the report is prepared as a comprehensive
technical report. When it is sponsored by a user-organization, it is written as a popular or summary
report. </p>
<p>
5. The Scope of the Report: The next step is to determine the scope of the contents with
reference to the type of the report and its intended purpose. For example, a research thesis or
dissertation to be submitted for award of a degree or diploma should narrate the total research process
and experience; the state of the problem, a review of previous studies, objectives of the study,
methodology, findings, conclusions and recommendations. </p>
<p>
6. The Style of Reporting: What should be the style of reporting? Should it be simple and clear
or elegant and pompous? Should it be technical or journalistic? These questions are decided with
reference to the target audience. For a detailed discussion on style, see Section 12.5 Principles of
Writing, below. </p>
<p>
7. The Format of the Report: The next step is to plan the format of the Report, which varies
according to the type of report. See Section 12.4: Research Report Format, below. </p>
<p>
8. Outline/ Table of Contents: The final step in planning report writing is to prepare a detailed
outline for each of the proposed chapters of the Report. An outline lends cohesiveness and direction
to report writing work. Until an outline is prepared, the researcher does not know that he has to do
and how to organise the presentation. </p>
<p>
A table of contents flows from the nature of the problem under study and the objectives of the
study, the hypothesis to be tested and the variables studied.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000401">401</pagenum>
<h1>
Styles of Outlining, Page no:401
</h1>
<p>
 There are two styles of outlining: (1) topic outline and (2) sentence outline. In the topic outline,
the topic heading and the sub-topic headings are noted and the points to be discussed under each
subheading may be denoted by one or two key words.  </p>
<p>
In the sentence outline the essential ideas to be discussed under each subtopic are stated. This
requires more thought and decisions on what to include and how to say it. It guards against later
forgetting certain specific points that one wanted to make.  </p>

                  <h1>  Exhibit 12.1: Styles of Outlining </h1>
<p>
Obviously, it is more difficult to write a sentence outline than a topic outline, but it is more
useful than the latter. A report “writes itself if it is based upon such an outline. Since it is much easier
to change the outline than to change the rough draft of the report, it is preferable to write a sentence
outline before drafting the report. Major omissions and commissions in the drafting stage can be
avoided if writing is based on a detailed outline. Of course, an outline should not be considered as
a rigid scheme to be strictly followed. It is a tentative one and is likely to undergo changes while the
report writing work proceeds. Exhibit 12.1 illustrates the two styles of outlining. </p>

<h1> Arrangement of Materials </h1>

<p>
After the detailed outline is developed, it should be studied carefully to see whether all aspects
have been fully covered and arranged in a logical sequence.
</p>
<pagenum page="normal" id="page000402">402</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:402
</h1>
<p>
The notes cards have to be sorted out and grouped topicwise. The groups of cards have to-be
then arranged in the order in which the respective topics have-been listed in the outline. Similarly the
statistical tables and tables of statistical computation results have to be arranged in the order in which
the related variables have been ordered in the outline. With these arrangements, the planning stage
of report writing ends.
</p>

 <h1>
            12.4 RESEARCH REPORT FORMAT
</h1>

<p>
In this Section, the format of a comprehensive technical report or doctoral thesis is discussed.
</p>

<h1> Report Outline  </h1>

<p>
A technical report has a number of clearly defined sections. While the headings of the sections
and their order may vary form one situation to another, the following is suggested as a broad sequence

<h1> Abstract </h1>

<p>
An abstract is a succinct statement of the findings of the project. It should be as brief as possible
and run about one or two pages. It is placed at the prefactory part of the report so that a reader can
get a quick overview of the report. It contains a brief and precise statement of the purpose and the
scope of the study and the method used for the investigation, and a bare summary of the findings or
the results of the investigation. The style of writing this abstract “places a premium on directness,
conciseness and condensation.”1  There should be no overemphasis of minor points, but important
conclusions should be given adequate treatment. </p>

                        <h1> B. BODY OF THE REPORT </h1>
<p>
After the prefactory items, the body of the report is presented. It is the major and main part of
the report. It covers the formulation of the problem studied, methodology, findings and discussion and
a summary of the findings and recommendations. In a comprehensive report, the body of the report
will consist of several chapters. </p>

<h1> 1. Introduction </h1>


<p>
This is the first chapter in the body of a research report. It is devoted for introducing the
theoretical background of the problem, its definition and formulation. It may consist of the following
sections. </p>

<p>
(a) Theoretical Background of the Topic: The first task is to introduce the background and
the nature of the problem so as to place it into a larger context to enable the reader to know its
significance in a proper perspective. This section summarises the theory or conceptual framework
within which the problem has been investigated. For example, the theoretical background in the thesis
entitled, “A Study of Social Responsibilities of Large—scale industrial units in India.2 discusses: The
nature of the Indian economy, the objective of India’s Constitution to establish an egalitarian social
order, the various approaches to the concept of social responsibility — property rights approach,
trusteeship approach, legitimacy approach, social responsibility approach — and their implications for
industries in the Indian context. Within this conceptual framework, the problem was defined, the
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000407">407</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:407
</h1>
<p>
objectives of the study were set up, the concept of social responsibility was operationalised and the
methodology of investigation was formulated. </p>
<p>
Similarly, the theoretical background in another doctoral thesis3 on “the relationship between
capital structure and cost of capital in larger cooperative undertakings”, deals with an overview of the
financial management decisions, the characteristics of cooperatives, the irrelevance of wealth     -maxi-
mization goal to cooperatives and the alternative ‘capital- cost- minimisation’ objective of financial
management in cooperatives. The problem under stUdy was formulated within this conceptual frame-
work. </p>
<p>
(b) The Statement of the Problem: In this section, why and how the problem was selected are
stated, the problem is clearly defined and its facets and significance are pointed out. </p>
<p>
(c) Review of Literature: This is an important part of the introductory chapter. It is devoted
for making a brief review of previous studies on the problem and significant writings on the topic
under study. This review provides a summary of the current state of knowledge in the area of
investigation. Which aspects have been investigated, what research gaps exist and how the present
study is an attempt to fill in that gap are highlighted. Thus the underlying purpose is “to locate the
present research in the existing body of research on the subjeCt and to point out what it contributes
to the subject. ”4 </p>
<p>
(d) The Scope of the Present Study: The dimensions of the study in terms of the geographical
area covered, the designation of the population being studied and the level of generality of the study
are specified. </p>
<p>
(e) The Objectives of the Study: The objectives of the study and the investigative questions
relating to each of the objectives are presented. </p>
<p>
(f) Hypotheses: The specific hypotheses to be tested are stated. The sources of their formulation
may be indicated. </p>
<p>
(g) Definition of Concepts: The reader of a report is not equipped to understand the study
unless he can know what concepts are used and how they are used. Therefore, the operational
definitions of the key concepts and variable’s of the study are presented, giving justifications for the
definitions adopted. How those concepts were defined by earlier writers and how the definitions of
the researcher were an improvement over earlier definitions may be explained. </p>
<p>
(h) Models: The models, if any, developed for depicting the relationships between variables
under study are presented with a review of their theoretical or conceptual basis. The underlying
assumptions are also stated. </p>

<h1> 2.The Design of the Study </h1>
<p>
 This part of the report is devoted for the presentation of all the aspects of the methodology and
their implementation, viz., overall typology, methods of data collection, sample design, data collection
instruments, methods of data processing and plan of analysis. Much of this material is taken from the
research proposal plan. The revisions, if any, made in the initial design and the reasons therefor
should be clearly stated. </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000408">408</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:408
</h1>
<p>
If pilot study was conducted before designing the main study, the details of the pilot study and
its outcome are reported. How the outcome of the pilot‘ study was utilised for designing the ﬁnal study
is also pointed out. </p>
<p>
The details of the study’s design should be so meticulously stated as to fully satisfy the criterion
of replicability. That is, it should be possible for another researcher to reproduce the study and test
its conclusions. </p>
<p>
Technical details may be given in the Appendix. Failure to furnish them could cast doubts on
the design. </p>
<p>
(a) Methodology: In this section, the overall typology of research (i.e., experimental, survey,
case study or action research) used, and the data collection methods (i.e., observation, interviewing
or mailing) employed are described. </p>
<p>
The sources of data, the sampling plan and other aspects of the design may be presented under
separate subheadings as described below. </p>
<p>
(b) Sources of Date: The sources from which the secondary and or primary data were gathered
are stated. In the case of primary data, the universe of the study and the unit of study are clearly
defined. The limitations of the secondary» data should be indicated. <p>
<p>
(c) Sampling Plan: The size of the universe from which the sample was drawn, the sampling
methods adopted and the sample size and the process of sampling are described in this section. What
were originally planned and what were actually achieved and the estimate of sampling error are to
be given. These details are crucial for determining the limitations of generalisability of the findings. </p>
<p>
(d) Data- collection Instruments: The types of instruments used for data collection and their
Contents, scales and other devices used for measuring variables, and the procedure of establishing
their validity and reliability are described in this section. </p>

<p> How the tools were pre-tested and finalised are also reported. </p>
<p>
(e) Field Work: When and how the field work was conducted, and what problems and diffi-
culties were faced during the field work are described under this sub—heading. The description of field
experiences will provide valuable lessons for future researches in organising and conducting their
field work. </p>
<p>
(f) Data Processing and Analysis Plan: The method — manual or mechanical — adopted for
data processing, and an account of methods used for data analysis and testing hypotheses must be
outlined and justified. If common methods like chi-square test, correlation test and analysis of vari-
ance were used, it is sufficient to say such and such methods were used. If an unusual or complex
method was used, it should be described in sufficient detail with the formula to enable the reader to
understand it. </p>
<p>
(g) An Overview of the Report: The scheme of subsequent chapters. is stated and the purpose
of each of them is briefly described in this section in order to give an overview of the presentation
of the results of the study. </p>
<p>
(h) Limitations of the Study: No research is free from limitations and weaknesses. These arise
from methodological weaknesses, sampling, imperfections, non- responses, data inadequacies, mea-
surement deficiencies and the like. Such limitations may vitiate the conclusions and their generalisability.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000409">409</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:409
</h1>
<p>
Therefore a careful statement of the limitations and weaknesses of the study should be made in order
to enable the reader to judge the validity of the conclusions and the general worth of the study in the
proper perspective. A frank statement of limitations is one of the hallmarks of an honest and com-
petent researcher. </p>

<h1> 3. Results, Findings and Discussion </h1>
<p>
This is the major part of the report. It should be an organised presentation of the results of
investigation and not a clutter of tables and charts.  </p>
<p>
It may be divided into several chapters depending upon the number of objectives of the study,
each being devoted for presenting the results pertaining to art objective. The chapters should bewell-
balanced, mutually related and arranged in logical sequence. </p>
<p>
The results should be reported as accurately and completely as possible, showing how they bear
on the research questions /hypotheses. </p>
<p>
Each chapter should be given an appropriate heading. For example, if one of the objectives of
a study is to study the relationship between the socio- economic characteristics of consumers and their
brand preferences, the chapter devoted to this objective may be given a heading of “Socio economic
variables and brand Preferences.” </p>
<p>
Each aspect of the topic of a chapter may be dealt with under an appropriate paragraph heading
in the following manner and order: </p>
<p>
1. A brief description of theory or classification pertaining to it.
2. . A citation of the relevant findings of previous significant studies.
3. A presentation of the summary table relating to the subject- matter.
4. Presentation of the findings and the inference drawn from it, stating how does the finding
Compare with the findings of earlier study/ s and whether the hypothesis is accepted or
rejected. </p>
<p>
The entire verbal presentation should run as an independent stream and such expressions "As
seen from the above Table "or “As the following table shows "need not be used. The table number
can be just referred to as” (See Table"...)” in the appropriate place. Exhibit 12.6 illustrates the above
points. </p>
<p>
Every table/ chart should be a self- contained and setf- explanatory unit within the body of the
report, and the presentation should be so clear that the reader be able to grasp the finding either by
reading the text or by looking at the table/chart. </p>

<h1> Age and Democratic Participation </h1>
<p>
The age of a member of a Cooperative as a correlate of the period of his membership is likely
to influence his democratic participation. An older member with his longer period of membership is
likely to be an activist. The study of Ostergaard and Halsey, on “Power in Cooperatives” (1965),
confirms this proposition. Therefore this proposition is tested in this study. Age is classified into three
categories: young (18 to 35 years), middle (36 to 50 years), and old (51 and above). </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000410">410</pagenum>

<p>
                            TABLE 12.1
         Age of Sample Members and Democratic Participation
 Age group             Number of members                 Average Democratic
                                                          Participation Score
Young                      41                                     4.54
Middle                     93                                     4.89
Old                        60                                     5.18
Total                     194                                     4.91
</p>
 <p>
The average participation score of the ‘middle’ age group is higher than that of the ‘young’ age
group, and that of the ‘old’ age group is higher than that of the ‘middle’ age group (See Table
12.1).</p>
 <p>
To test the significance of these differences the analysis of variance test was adopted. The test
was not significant. The relationship between age and democratic participation was further analysed
by Chi—square’ test. The value of XZ is 5.92202, while the table value at 5% level is 9.49. Hence there
is no relation between age and democratic participation for this sample. The unexpected result may
be due to the fact that interest in the affairs of cooperatives might not grow with advancement of age,
but might depend on other factors like participation in business, cooperative knowledge, etc. More-
over, age is not necessarily a correlate of membership period.”

                <p> Exhibit 12.6 A Model for Presentation of Results </p>
<p>
Negative or unexpected results should also be stated frankly withOut a tortured attempt to
explain them away. </p>
<p>
Each Section or chapter should end with a summary and lead into the next section or chapter
with a smooth transition sentence. </p>

<h1> 4. Summary, Conclusions and Recommendations </h1>
<p>
The presentation of analysis and results is followed by a separate final chapter. This chapter is
more extensive than the abstract given in the beginning of the report. </p>
<p>
This chapter should be a self-contained summary of the whole report, containing a summary of
essential background information, findings and inclusions, and recommendations. </p>
<p>
After a brief statement of the problem, the purpose of the study and the methodology used in
the investigation, the findings and conclusions are presented. This summary may be more or less a
reproduction of the topical sentences of the various findings and conclusions presented in the main
body.</p>
<p>
Findings are statements of factual information based upon the data analysis, e. g., “The average
democratic participation of members increases with an increase in the level of cooperative knOwl-
edge." </p>
<p>
On the other hand, conclusions are inferences/generalisations drawn from the findings and
relate to hypotheses. They are the answers to the research questions or the statements of acceptance
or rejection of hypotheses, e.g., “The coefficient of correlation between cooperative knowledge and
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000411">411</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:411
</h1>
<p>
democratic participation is significant at 1% level, which shows that cooperative knowledge is Strongly
and positively related to democratic participation. The hypothesis relating to this is proved. That is,
Cooperative knowledge promotes democratic participation in cooperatives.5 </p>
<p>
The formulation of conclusions is the most difficult aspect of report— writing, A researcher
sometimes may be tempted to overgeneralize on the basis of his limited data or previously held
convictions, not tested by the analysis. It 1s, therefore, essential to cultivate the qualities of skepticism
and modesty. </p>
<p>
Conclusions on Methodology: An investigation may throw out valuable lessons on the practical
methodology — efficacy or otherwise of approaches and methods and tools adopted for collection of
data, ordering items in data collection instruments, field work and the like. These lessons will be of
immense use in planning and conducting similar studies in future. Hence a section may be devoted
for presenting the methodological experiences. If such experiences are not reported, every researcher
may have to learn by trial and error with no cumulative build—up of knowledge. </p>
<p>
The Recommendations for Policy/ Action: These should flow from the findings and conclusions.
These are the actions suggested to the policy makers/ users of the research findings. Recommendations
made by other researchers or study teams/ committees, however important they may be, shOuld not be
reproduced if they are not related to the findings of the present study. </p>
<p>
The recommendations should be specific and should not be mere vague statements like “Mem-
ber education should be organised; ” “State regulation should be liberalised.” They should rather
indicate ‘what’, ‘how’ and other aspects of the action suggested.  </p>
<p>
Suggestions for further research: In the course of conducting research, new questions may arise
or new problems may be uncovered. It is appropriate to indicate them along with suggestions for
appropriate methodology for studying them. </p>

<h1>                         C. TERMINAL ITEMS
Bibliography                                              </h1>
<p>
This is the first of the terminal items presented at the end of the research report. The bibliog-
raphy lists in alphabetical order all published and unpublished references used by the writer in
preparing the report. All books, articles and reports and other documents may be presented in one
common list in the alphabetical order of their authors. Alternatively, the bibliography may be clas-
sified into three or four sections: (a) Books, (b) Articles, (c) Reports, and (d) other documents, and
in each section relevant references may be arranged in alphabetical order. </p>
<p>
The purpose of bibliography is different from that of footnotes While the bibliography gives a
list of materials relating to the topic under study as a ready reference to the reader, the footnotes,
found at the bottom of the respective pages or at the end of a section/chapter, specifically cite the
exact sources and pages where quoted or paraphrased materials are found. </p>
<p>
Format: Bibliography listing should be done with proper format in order to serve its purpose.
FOr details see Section 12.6 Footnotes and Bibliography Format, below. </p>

                          <h1> 12.5 PRINCIPLES OF WRITING </h1>
<p>
The writing of a research report is governed by certain principles or standard practices. These
are described below: </p>

<h1> Organization of the report </h1>
<p>
A research report requires clear organization. Each chapter may be divided into two or more
sections with appropriate headings and in each section margin headings and paragraph headings may
be used to indicate subject shifts. Headings serve as pointer to where the discussion is going
</p>
<p>
Standard usage in paragraphing and in giving headings to topics and subtopics should be
followed. The general grouping is from “Centered section headings” to “marginal headings” to “para
graph headings’ then to individual paragraphs. (See Exhibit 12.7). </p>
<p>
Physical presentation is another aspect of organization. A page should not be fully filled in from
top to bottom. Wider margins should be provided on both sides and on top and bottom as well. </p>

<h1> Style </h1>
<p>
A research report requires a style different from other academic writings like essay, fiction or
poetry. In the latter, the richness of words usage is often desirable to achieve beautiful effects. But
a research report, being a formal presentation of an objective, unbiased investigation should be written
at a formal level of standard English. </p>

                             <h1> CENTERED SECTION HEADING </h1>
<p>
The centered section heading is placed in the centre of the page and is usually in solid capitals. It
is separated from other textual material by two or three lines’ space. </p>

<h1> Marginal Heading </h1>
<p>
This, heading is used for a subdivision in each Section. It starts from the left side margin without
leaving any space. No punctuation mark like full-stop or semicolon is used at the end of this heading. The
matter is presented below the heading and not along its line. </p>
<p>
Paragraph Heading: This is Used to head an important aspect of the subject matter discussed in a
subdivision. There is some space between the margin and this heading. The matter is presented as a
continuation of the heading along the same line. </p>
<p>
The matter presented under each paragraph heading may be grouped under several paragraphs with-
but separate headings, each dealing with a unified topic or idea. </p>
<p>
A chapter may contain several sections with centered headings; each section may contain several
marginal headings, and under each marginal heading there may be two or more paragraph headings.
</p>

</h1>

<p>
It dues not require elegant word usage and allusion. It just needs a plain discourse with accu-
racy, clarity, coherence, conciseness and readability. </p>
<p>
Accuracy the first requirement of the style in report writing. The report should be factual with
objective presentation. Exaggerations and superlatives should be avoided. </p>
<p>
Clarity is another requirement of presentation. It is achieved by using familiar terms and com-
mon words and unambiguous statements, explicitly defining concepts and unusual terms and by
taking care of logical flow of ideas and sequence of sentences. </p>
<p>
Coherence is an essential part of clarity. Each sentence must be so linked with other sentences
that the writer’s thoughts move smoothly and naturally from one statement to the next. </p>
<p>
Guidelines for ensuring coherence:
—— Arrange sentences within a paragraph in a logical sequence.
— Arrange paragraphs in a logical sequence.
—— Place at the beginning of a paragraph the topic sentence to link it with the one before it and
to prepare the reader for what is to follow.
— Use conjunctions, adverbs and phrases as connectives, e.g. but, because, therefore;... on the
other hand, on the contrary. </p>
<p>
Conciseness refers to the absence of waste wordage. Statements must be succinct and precise.
Useless and meaningless words and verbose explanations should be avoided, without, of course,
omitting pertinent information. Conciseness calls for repeated review, revision and condensation
 </p>
<p>
Readability is an important requirement of good communication. Even a technical report should
be easily understandable. Technicalities should be translated into language understandable by the
reader interested in the results of the study. The readability may be achieved by using (a) active verbs
rather than passive verbs, (b) correct and exact names, references, facts and figures, (c) simple words
and (d) sentences. The style of presentation should be such as to encourage rapid reading and quick
comprehension. </p>
<p>
The writer should keep in mind the reading ability of the target audience, have concern for the
meanings of words, and try to humanize the writing style in keeping with the topic and occasion. He
should also avoid unclear writings. </p>

<h1> Unclear writings </h1>
<p>
Clarity and readability call for avoiding the following types of unclear writings:

0  Avoid the jargon, and pretentious and pompous style, e.g., a sentence taken from an un-
named work and quoted by Goode and Halt (1952, p. 366):  </p>
<p>
These concepts can hold only for ranges of variation of circumstances not too large to invalidate
the assumption that for practical purposes the particular constant relations between the values of
analytical elements which these type concepts in concrete case represent, will not be so unreal as to
exceed an acceptable margin of error. Such unclear writing arises out of unclear thinking.  </p>
<p>
 Avoid offensive words, e.g., adding the sufﬁx “wise” to a noun, or adding “ize” to nouns
  or adjectives to make verbs.

 Omit needless words that cause verbosity, e.g.,  </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000414">414</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 414
</h1>
<p>
 Avoid superfluous phrases such as
Authorities agree that....
It is a well-known fact....
Although certainly not a new finding, it is important to point out
 Avoid abstract words and use the concrete, e.g.,  </p>
<p>
 Avoid words that exaggerate such as stupendous, immeasurable, gigantic, awfully, dread-
fully...

 Avoid tautology or repetition, e.g,, in the phrases, ‘joint partnership’, ‘return back’, ‘de-
clined to accept’, ‘the true facts’, the words in italics are redundant and should be omitted.

 Avoid smothered verbs and instead use vigorous verbs. </p>
<p>
A verb is smothered when it is buried inside another word and thus loses its power to state a
clear relationship. You can restore the power of the verb by linking an idea to it, and by removing
the suffixes like ‘tion’, ‘ion’ , ‘ment’, ‘ency’ added to the verbs for converting them into nouns. For
example, the following rewritten sentences replace the smothered verbs with action verbs: </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000415">415</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 415
</h1>

<p>
Avoid cliches or stereotyped phrases such as,

— as a rule

— be that as it may

— bear in mind

— by and large

— conspicuous by its absence

— it goes without saying

— last but not least

— in the first place
— to all intents and purposes

0 Avoid using slang, i.e., language of a colloquial type, such as ‘on the dot’; ‘cushy’; ‘posh’;
‘had it; ‘fallen for if; etc.  </p>

<h1>
Grammar
</h1>

<p>
Presentation should be free from spelling and grammatical errors. If the writer is not strong in
grammar and correct language usage, he should get his manuscript corrected by a language expert.
</p>

<p>
The research writer should consult a good handbook of language usage (see the “Suggested
Readings” at the end of this chapter). </p>

<p>
A summary of important rules of grammar is given below:

Spelling: Each word must be spelled correctly.
1. Use preferred spelling found in a standard dictionary.
2. Refer to the best available authority for correct spelling of proper names not found in a
dictionary.
3. Distinguish between singular and plural forms of anglicized nouns of foreign origin; for
example: </p>

 <p>
Punctuation: Some desk dictionaries contain rules of “punctuation, and good language usage
books contain detailed explanations and rules. Carefully observe the rules of punctuations. </p>

 <p>
Capitalization; Standard practices for capitalizing words in English should be followed when
writing in English or when quoting English titles. </p>

 <p>
Principal words of titles and parts of specific works are capitalized. Principal words in captions
of tables and exhibits are also capitalized. </p>

 <p>
Person: A research paper embodies the results of a scientific investigation and is not of a
personal nature. Most authorities, therefore, believe it should be written in the third person, and the  </p>

<p>
first and the second person pronouns (I, me, we, our, your etc.) should be avoided. When the writer
has to refer to himself, such expressions as “the researcher”, or “the writer” are preferred. </p>

<p>
Voice: Active voice is preferable to passive voice, because the passive reverses the normal order
of ideas and tends to slow down reading and understanding. Avoid such expressions as “It is esti-
mated ...”, “It can be foreseen ...”, “There has existed and the like. </p>

<p>
Tense: Use the past tense for
(a) citing findings of others (e.g., Srinivas found that...)

(b) describing how you conducted the study (e.g., A structured interview schedule was devel-
oped and pie-tested...) and

(c) reporting specific past behaviours of your subjects (e.g., Some of the sample respondents
were not readily available...) </p>

<p>
Use present tense for

(a) presenting the findings of your study (e.g., the factors which consumers consider most in
selecting brands are ...) and (b) stating generalizations (e.g., “one of the most important conclusions
to emerge from the World Fertility Study is that it is feasible to conduct surveys based on strict
probability samples in most developing countries”) </p>

<p>
Gender: Do not use masculine nouns and pronouns when the content refers to both genders.
The generic use of ‘man’, ‘he’, ‘his’ and ‘him’ to refer to both men and women is not only misleading
in many instances but also make the readers visualize and think of male persons.6 To avoid this
confusion,

 Use male pronouns when referring to males.
  Use female pronouns when referring to females.

 Use plural when referring to mixed group (e.g., The individual who display prejudice in
their personal relations...). </p>

<h1> Numerals </h1>

<p> Numerals: Arabic and Roman numerals should be used as follows: </p>

                      <h1>   Arabic  </h1>

</p>
<p>
Words and Numerals: There are certain conventions that determine how and when to use
numbers and when to use words.

1. Use words to state numbers in the following cases:
    1.numbers smaller than one hundred
    2.round numbers (e.g., multiplies of one hundred)
    3.a fraction (e.g., the twenty- fifth anniversary...)
    4.ordinal numbers (e.g., the twenty- fifth anniversary...)
    5.the number at the beginning of a sentence (e. g., Forty-five of the 897 participants were
      Christians) as no sentence should begin with a number.

2. Use the word ‘present’ as one word with a number, and the word, ‘percentage’ without
reference to a number.

3. Use the percent symbol (%) only in tables and figures.

4. Use numerals to express page, street, telephone number, dates, and quantities combined
with abbreviations and symbols. In dates B.C. follows the year and AD. precedes it. (e.g.,
1800 B.C., AD. 1890).

5. Use Arabic numerals to express decimals and percentages, even when they are smaller than
one hundred (e.g., The records show that 35 percent of members had attended the general
meeting.)

6. Express references to table and exhibit/ figure numbers numerically.

7. Express textual reference to numbers taken from figures and tables in the form of numerals
and not in words even if the numbers are small, (e. g., Table 7 shows that only 19 tests were
run.)
</p>

<h1> Enumeration </h1>
<p>
Items or points can be given special emphasis by listing them in one of the following forms of
enumeration: (1) textual and (2) tabular enumeration.

1. Textual enumeration is used when the items are so brief that they can easily be woven into
the text, e.g.,

The essential characteristics of style in research writing are (1) accuracy, (2) clarity, (3) coher-
ence, (4) conciseness, and (5) readability.

2. Tabular enumeration is preferable when the length and/ or number of items would make a
cumbersome sentence if run into the text or when items are long phrases or complete sentences e.g., </p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page000418">418</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:418
</h1>
<p>
The following are some specific suggestions made for ethically acceptable cross- cultural studies:
(1) Research should avoid actions violating the ethical standards of the group being studied.
(2) Studies should show sensitivity to each political and cultural situation.
(3) Research participants should be informed of the general purposes and sponsorship of the
project.
(4) The study should ensure informed consent and avoid invasions of privacy.
(5) The research experience should not cause physical, mental, social or political harm to
participants. </p>

<h1> Quotations </h1>
<p>
In a research report, as in most other writings, quotations are used to cite definitions, view
points, conclusions, etc. of other writers and authors. As a research "study is an original critical
analysis of data and information, and not a mere compilation of the words of other writers, quotations
should be used sparingly. Certain types of reports, however, such as an analysis of the works of some
author, require more quotations than others.  </p>
<p>
Unless the contrary is clearly stated, the citation of another’s opinions or conclusions often
signifies the writer’s acceptance of them as his own. Therefore a careful investigation of the grounds
for the validity of such citations is essential. </p>
<p>
Forms of Quotations: Quotations may be direct (verbatim) or indirect (paraphrased).
Direct (verbatim) quotations should be employed:

(1) When giving the wording of laws, official rulings, and important edicts;
(2) When citing mathematical, scientific and other formulas;
(3) When citing the definitions of concepts; and
(4) When a well expressed significant idea is quoted.  </p>
<p>
Any matter that is directly quoted must be reproduced exactly in all details: wording, spelling,
capitalisation, punctuation, and paragraphing Careful comparison with original sources should be
made to check the accuracy of direct quotations. </p>
<p>
Some rules to be observed:
1. Use double quotation marks to enclose direct quotations run into the text, e.g.,

“The power of concentration,” says Swami Vivekananda, “is the only key to the treasure-house
if knowledge.”

2. Use single quotation marks for a quotation within a short, run-in quotation, e.g.,

In a review of a book of essays on fiction, Moore agreed with Robbe-Grillet that “at for things,
all our literature has not yet succeeded in eroding their smallest corner, in flattening their slightest
curve' --"....

3. Fit short direct quotations not over three type-Written lines in length with quotation marks
to the text itself, e.g.,
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000419">419</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 419
</h1>
<p>
In his Essays on Gita, Sri Aurobindo writes, “The Gita is not a weapon for dialectical warfare;
it is a gate opening on the whole world of spiritual truth and experience it maps out, but it does not
cut up or builds walls or hedges to confine our vision.”  </p>
<p>
4. If a direct quotation is more than three typewritten lines in length, set it off from the text in
a separate paragraph, or paragraphs, single-spaced. Opening and closing quotation marks are omitted
e. g., </p>
<p>
In his lectures delivered on his ‘Master’, Sri Ramakrishna, in New York and England in 1896,
Swami Vivekananda said: </p>
<p>
This is the message of Sri Ramakrishna to the modern world: Do not care for doctrines, do not
care for dogmas, or sects, or churches, or temples; they count for little compared with the essence of
existence in each man, which is spirituality; and the more this is developed in a man, the more
powerful is he for good. Earn that first, acquire that, and criticise no one, for all doctrines and creeds
have some good in them. Show by your lives that religion does not mean words, or names, or sects;
but that it means spiritual realisation. (The Complete Works, Vol. iv, p. 187.)  </p>
<p>
Indirect Quotation means paraphrasing a given passage of another writer in our own words. This
must involve genuine rephrasing. An example is given below:

On the issue of the ethics of policy research, Warwick and Pettigrew emphasize that social
scientists should adhere strictly to the standards of the craft of research whatever be their own and
their sponsor’s value convictions. (In D. Callahan and B. Jennings(eds.), Ethics, the Social Sciences
and Policy Analysis, New York: Plenum Press, 1982.)  </p>
<p>
Documentation: Every quotation used, either direct or indirect, should be acknowledged through
a footnote.  </p>

<p>
Capitalization and punctuation: Although the rule requires that the capitalization and punc-
tuation of quoted materials be reproduced exactly, good grammatical practice calls for an exception:7  </p>

<p>
Unless the first word of a quotation is a proper noun or adjective, it should not be capitalised,
if it forms a grammatical whole with what precedes it, e.g.,  </p>

<p>
“Swami Vivekananda defines education as ‘the manifestation of the perfection already in man.’ ”  </p>

<p>
If, however, the quotation is considered to be a grammatical whole by itself, the first letter is
capitalised as in the original, e.g.,  </p>

<p>
Commenting on the term ‘model’, Rigby said, “An organization chart may be a recipe or a set
of instructions rather than a model.”  </p>

<p>
Ellipses: Omissions in quoted matter are permitted if the original meaning is not altered. Such
omissions are to be indicated by the sign of ellipsis (...) See the previous example. Omission of one
or more paragraphs of prose is indicated by a full line of ellipsis.  </p>

<p>
Adding Italics: The italicizing of any part of a quotation not italicized in the original must be
indicated by the insertion of a phrase —— italics not in the original — within square brackets.
[ ].  </p>

<p>
Interpolation: Any corrections or remarks by the person quoting should be inserted in square
brackets. </p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000420">420</pagenum>
<h1>
Abbreviations, Page no: 420
</h1>
<p>
   Do not abbreviate words in the text; spell out them in full (except decorations like Dr., Rev.,
and Hon. preceding proper names; Esq., Sr., and Jr. following proper names; and measurement
denominations such as 16 mm., 250 cc., and 4 feet 10 in.) </p>
<p>
This rule does not apply to materials included in the footnotes, appendices, bibliographies,
tables and figures where abbreviations are rather desirable. </p>

<h1> Statistical Test Results </h1>
<p>
A researcher may make use of various mathematical and statistical techniques like matrices,
correlation, regression equations, multivariate analysis, significance tests and the like for analysing
data and testing hypotheses, depending on the needs of the study. Naturally he presents the results
of such analyses in the report. How should this presentation be made is significant. A mere statement
of the results in technical form such as </p>

<p> X2 = 9.74; r = 0.84; R2 = 0.64  </p>

<p>
will not do. What such results mean in terms of the subject matter of the study should be brought out.
Above all, the statistical limitations of the analyses should be clearly pointed out. For example, a few
extreme cases will bias sharply the arithmetic mean; percentages based on meagre samples may lead
to misleading comparisons, if the samples are not representative of the population, the findings cannot
be generalised. Such limitations should be identified and openly reported without any reservation. </p>

<h1> Presentation of Tables, Charts and Graphs </h1>

<p>
Tables, Charts, Graphs and other forms of visual aids are used to provide a basis for discussion
on the text or to illustrate and classic points made in the text. Graphs and charts help the reader to
understand even the more complex tabulations. Hence their presentation in the report requires special
care. A reader reads these materials in a frame of mind different from that in reading the verbal matter.
In his mind tables and other exhibits are set apart from the verbal presentation. Recognising this
actor, tables should be presented as self-contained and self-explanatory units. This is achieved by
living accurate, clear and simple headings and footnotes to the tables and other exhibits. All these
illustrative materials should be as simple and as clear as possible. They should not be cramped. Too
much detail in a single table or chart or graph will make it difficult to understand. Then the very
purpose of using it as an easy and simple means of conveying information is defeated. </p>

<p>
All illustrative materials must be clearly labelled and numbered. Different types of illustration
should be separately numbered serially: Table 1,2,3...; Exhibit 1,2,3 Graph 1,2,3....  </p>

                     <h1> 12.6 DOCUMENTATION: FOOTNOTES AND BIBLIOGRAPHY </h1>

<h1> Documentation </h1>
<p>
The ethics of scholarship require proper acknowledgement of all source materials by the writer.
This is a matter of intellectual honesty and validation of his work as well. Credit for borrowed words,
ideas, symbols or other forms of expression should be given and their sources should be stated in the
text or footnotes. Source cards prepared while reviewing literature provide the information required
or this documentation.   </p>
<p>
There are two alternative models for documenting sources of ideas and information: (1) foot-
notes and (2) references — cited format.   </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000421">421</pagenum>

<h1>
Footnotes, Page no:421
</h1>
<p>
Footnotes are of two kinds: content and reference. Content notes contains explanatory materials.
Reference notes serve as documentation of sources or as means for cross-references (see below):
Purposes: Footnotes serves several purposes:
1. To acknowledge indebtedness:
This acknowledgement is necessary when an exact quotation is used or when a passage of
another writer is paraphrased. Common facts of general knowledge require no citation.

2. To amplify or clarify the ideas or information presented in the text:
The footnotes used for this purpose are called content footnotes. They are used to clarify
thoughts or concepts presented in the text without complicating the presentation. These
notes may include explanatory material, technical details, incidental comments, additional
information and the like. Of course, value and significant facts, and directly relevant ideas
should not be transferred to footnotes, but should be included in the text itself.

3. To establish the validity of evidence:
All important statements of fact must be supported by evidence of their validity. Reference
is given in footnotes to the source of such evidence.

4. To refer the reader to further sources of information on the subject under discussion.
5. To give the original version of material that has been translated in the text.
6. To provide cross—reference to various parts of the thesis:

Reference to materials appearing in an appendix or in earlier or later portions of the report
facilitate cross-reference or location of related ideas. These references are made in the
footnotes, as well as in the text. </p>

 <p>
Placement: A footnote citation is indicated by placing an index number, i.e., a superscript or
numeral, at the point of reference. This may be immediately following an author’s name, a title, a
sentence or a paragraph. In the case of a directly quoted or a paraphrased except, the superscript must
appear at the end of the quotation or paraphrase. </p>

<p>
The superscript numeral must appear at the top of the line both in the text and in a footnote.
No mark of punctuation is used after the superscript numeral, ether in the text or in a footnote.
 </p>

 <p>
 Footnotes are single-spaced, with double spacing between two consecutive citations. Footnotes
are numbered consecutively within each Chapter or throughout the entire report, if they are a few in
number. Exhibit 12.8 illustrates the process of footnoting. </p>
<p>
Superscripts may be confusing for mathematical or scientific formulas; in their cases, symbols
like asterisk (*), daggers (T), double dagger, two asterisks, etc. may be used. </p>
<p>
Footnote contents: Footnote citations for reference should contain full information for identifi-
cation, viz., author’s name, the title of the publication, place of publication, publisher’s name, year
and page number(s). A mere Citation of the author’s name and title only will not do. </p>
<p>
Basic Format: Author’s name, title of the work, place of publication: Publisher’s name, Year,
page no. (s). Note the punctuations. Page number to be preceded by “p” if single or “pp”. if two or
more pages. Title has to be underlined.  </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000422">422</pagenum>

<p>
The first reference to a work should contain all the above details. If the immediate next refer-
ence, i.e.,  </p>


<p>
Krishnaswami defines Management by Objective (MBO) as “a system of participative manage-
ment on the basis of position- wise result— oriented, measurable and time- bound objectives integrated
with the organizational objectives, and with the environment."1  </p>

 <p>
Drucker2 lays great stress on the concept of self-control. Control, according to him means “the
ability to direct one-self and one’s work”3 on the basis of objective.  </p>


<p>
The objectives at one level are the means for the objectives at the higher level; and the end for
the objectives at the lower level. This chain of means-end-sequence continues. It emphasizes that
objectives at different levels in the hierarchy must be balanced and integrated and be consistent one
with another.4  </p>


<p>
An analysis of the environment5 is an important step in establishing the organization’s strategic
and long-term goals. </p>
<p>
Consecutive reference is also from the same work, then simply use the Latin abbreviation ‘Ibid’
(meaning in the same work) and write the page numbers. (For abbreviations that can be used in
footnotes and reference, see Section 12.7, below).  </p>
<p>
If the same work is cited after one or more citations from other publications, then write the
author’s name, abbreviation ‘op.cit.’, and the page numbers. </p>
<p>
When a second but non—consecutive reference is made to the exact source (i.e., the same work
and page) previously cited, ‘loc.cit. ’ (‘the place cited’) is substituted for ‘op. cit.’ the author’s name
is given to identify the work, but page numbers are not mentioned, because they are unnecessary.
 </p>
 <p>
Examples of footnotes for citing various types of materials, books, articles, Government publi-
cations, etc. are given below. The writer should carefully note the formats, punctuation, abbreviations
and other details. </p>
<p>
Author’s name in Footnote: As per the general practice in vogue, the name starts with the first
name in footnotes, but in a bibliography it starts with the second or surname. This variation may cause
some difficulty and confusion, because the source of details for both footnotes and bibliography is
the same, viz., source cards. In source cards the names are noted starting with the surnames. I,
therefore, suggest that the same format (i.e., the surname format) may be adopted for both footnotes
and bibliography in order to avoid the confusion arising out of the conventional practice. </p>

<h1>
Reference- cited Format, Page no:425
</h1>

<p>
The reference- cited format of documentation consists of a single listing of research references
at the end of a paper or thesis. This is preferred in most scientific writings. It is most often headed
"Reference Cited " or “References.” Sources are referred to in the text by author and year publication,
and page number. References are listed in alphabetical order at the end of the report/ paper without
numbering. They include page numbers, if page numbers are not mentioned in the references cited-
in the text. </p>
<p>
Examples of sources cited in the text and their listing under References are given below: </p>

<h1> Citation in the text </h1>
<p>
Becker and Geer (1975) suggested that participant observation was to be preferred to interview-
ing....

Martin Trow (1957) argued that one method was not inherently superior over another.

Proponents of survey research are the first to admit the problems of bias and error which can
occur (see Schuman, 1982).

“It is not that the numbers are necessarily false but that they draw the inquirer’s attention away
from what is of crucial significance”, (Leach, 1967, p. 82).-

“No amount of statistical sophistication can set right the distortions and falsifications introduced
by wrong data” (Srinivas, Shaw and Ramaswamy, 1979, p. vii).

Gerald Berreman (1972, pp. xvii-Ivii) has ably highlighted the problems of sample surveys in
his essay on his field experiences in the Himalayas.

Computers are now universally used in the industrial world to handle quantitative social data,
while their use in the developing world is less general. (For an excellent review of the practical and
technical aspects of data processing, see Hursh- Cesar and Roy, 1976, pp. 347-98).</p>

<p>
If a cited author, say Arul had published more than one article in 1986, the citation for a
particular reference would be Am] (1986 b: 25-28) indicating that this was the second entry with a
publication date of 1986 for Arul.  </p>

<p>
There are acceptable variations in footnote formats. For example, in some, the place of pub—
lication is cited after the name of the publisher, in some, the place of publication and publisher’s name
are enclosed in brackets; in some, the year enclosed in parentheses appears immediately after the
author’s name and so on. What is important is use of a particular format consistently in a paper/ thesis. </p>

<h1> Bibliography </h1>
<p>
The Bibliography is a list of references relating to a topic or subject. It is located at the end of
the main body of the report. It contains all the information found in a first footnote relating to a work. </p>
<p>
The function of bibliography is different from that of footnotes. While footnotes are used to cite
authority for specific statements quoted or paraphrased, the bibliography lists in alphabetical order
references used by the writer. The footnotes designate the exact place (i.e., page/s) where the quoted
matter is located. But the bibliography just gives identification details for the works, as a whole. There
may be several footnotes to a work, but there is only one entry for it in bibliography. The footnote
appears only when a specific matter from a work is cited, whereas, a work may be listed in the
bibliography even if it is not quoted in the report, provided it is related to the subject of the study. </p>
<p>
Format: The formats for bibliographical listing for books, reports, articles etc. are same as the
formats for footnotes except one difference. That is, no page number is stated in the case of books
and reports listed in the Bibliography. </p>
<p>
Another difference is often indicated: While in the first footnote relating to a work, author’s
name begins with the first name (e.g,, Peter F. Drucker), in the bibliography, name begins With the
second or the surname (e.g., Drucker, Peter F.). As the information required for the footnotes and the
bibliography is secured from the same source, viz., source cards, the author-surname format may be
used in both cases, as explained earlier. </p>
<p>
Classification: References may be grouped according to their form of publications; for ex-
amples, books may be listed in one group; periodicals in a second group, and reports in another group.
In each group references should be arranged in alphabetical order of the surnames of authors or by
initial letter of the first words of listing. </p>

<p> A bibliography containing less than twenty titles need not be sub-divided into categories.
</p>

<p>
When there are two or more works by the same author repetition of his name is avoided by
substituting for it an unbroken line eight spaces in length, beginning With the left margin, e.g., Good
Carter V. ed., Dictionary of Education, New York: McGraw—Hill. 1973. </p>

<p>
1. The heading BIBLIOGRAPHY or REFERENCES is placed an inch space below the top of
the paper. It is centered between the margins. No terminal punctuation is used after it.

2. The first entry is placed a double space below the title. If, however, there is a category
heading, the heading is placed a triple space below the title, and the first entry is placed a double
space below the category heading.
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page000428">428</pagenum>

<p>
3. The entries are arranged in an underhung, single-spaced form, with double spacing between
items. Each entry begins flush with the left margin, and the second and ensuing lines, if any, are
indented four spaces.

4. Where there are two or more works by the same author listed consecutively, repetition of his
name is avoided by substituting for it an unbroken line eight spaces in length, beginning flush with
the left margin and followed by a period (i.e., two-letter space).

5. In the case of annotated bibliography, the annotation should begin on the next line below
bibliographical entry, with the first line indented another four spaces from the underhung indention
(a total of eight spaces from the margin). Ensuing lines should be indented four spaces from the usual
margin.   </p>

                        12.7 WRITING THE REPORT
                        </h1>

<h1>  Introduction </h1>

<p>
No researcher, however experienced, can write a research report in final form in one draft. The
report needs several revisions and rewriting. This hard fact has to be kept in mind while starting the
writing work. The writer should arrange the following materials in an order and keep them on the
table ready for use: </p>

<p>
1. The detailed outlines for chapters
2. Note cards arranged in the order of chapters
3. Source cards arranged in an alphabetical order
4. Statistical tables, charts and results of analysis, each in a separate sheet and
5. Plain sheets of paper and a good pen.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000430">430</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 430
</h1>
<p>
The writer should overcome the initial inertia — the tendency to put off beginning to overcome
his tendency, the writer should set aside a section of free time for the report writing work. If this can
e as long as an entire morning, so much the better. He should establish a regular schedule for writing
until the work is done. He should begin drafting as soon as some thoughts on the topic crystallizes
on his mind. Once he starts writing, he should keep going, and maintain a psychological momentum.
He should plan for an atmosphere of quiet and isolation. I recall what I did when I wrote my doctoral
thesis. I was used to get up at 4.30 AM and concentrate on writing in my study room without any
disturbance and similarly on weekends. I used to go to my room in the college and concentrate on
writing. Any serious writing requires free mind, and free atmosphere.   </p>

<h1> First Draft </h1>
<p>
On what the writer should concentrate in the first draft stage? He should concentrate on sub-
tance, i.e., fullness of facts, as per the planned outline. In writing the first draft, maintaining a flow
of ideas is more important than choosing exact words. Hence the entire first draft work should be
completed without any stopping for editing.   </p>

<h1> The points to be kept in mind in writing the first draft are: </h1>
<p>
1. Keep in mind that you are writing for communicating with the target audience.
2. Keep the purpose of each chapter, section and paragraph in mind.
3. Expand the outline and put all ideas that occur on paper.
4. Do not hesitate to write in any order those sections of your total work that seem to have
grown ripe in your mind.

5. Do not struggle for words and phrases. Write down something that occurs. As Barzun and
Graff have aptly said, “Paper is not granite, and in a first draft you are not carving eternal
words in stone.”8 Inappropriate words can be replaced while revising the draft.

6. When any idea, word or phrase refuses to come to mind, leave it blank. It will arise easily
on revision.

7. Write different sections and major ideas on separate sheets to facilitate additions and
cuttings.

8. Write on one side of the sheet leaving larger margin (say 2") on the left side.
9. Leave double space between lines to provide for corrections.
10. Do not copy the tables on the text, just pin them in the appropriate places. This is necessary
for avoiding recopying tables at every revision.

11. Document each borrowed idea or information —— whether quoted exactly, paraphrased or
summarised — by a footnote 0n the same page (See “Footnotes” in Section 12.6, above).

12. Give appropriate headings to chapters, sections and paragraphs.

13. When the first draft is completed, make sure that all research objectives have been analysed
and discussed adequately, all research questions have been answered adequately, and all the
hypotheses have been tested adequately.

14. Ensure the correctness of facts and citations.   </p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000431">431</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no: 431
</h1>
<p>
After the first draft work is over, keep the matter in a cupboard and forget it for some days. Later
take it up for reading and revision with a fresh outlook.  </p>

<h1> Revisions </h1>
<p>
The first draft should be read carefully again and again and edited thoroughly and revised. Any
writing improves upon revision. In revising the first draft, the attention should be given to form,
language, readability, clarity and lucidity. With an open and critical mind the researcher must correct,
carve, cut, add and polish. The following points may be kept in mind: </p>
<p>
1.Keep in mind the requirements of a research report (See Section 12.1. in this chapter, above;
and the principles of report writing). (See 12.5, above).
2.Fill in the blanks with appropriate ideas, words or phrases.
3.Reorganize ideas wherever necessary.
4.Eliminate gaps in continuity and unclear statements.
5.Replace inappropriate words by exact and apt words.
6.Omit needless words and expressions such as “as a matter of fact”, “owing to the fact that
...” etc.
7.Simplify sentences and improve their effectiveness.
8. Cut off repetitions by giving cross references.
9. Improve the readability and clarity of the writing.
10.Correct the spelling and grammatical errors.
11.Make a critical evaluation 0f the draft as if you are evaluating another writer’s draft, using
the following Test Questions:
Evaluations of the draft report: Test Questions  </p>

<h1> Methodological aspects </h1>
/p>
(1) Has the research plan — as originally drawn up and as ultimately realised — been presented
in detail? (This will enable the reader to know the difficulties faced by the researcher and
take a correct view of his findings and conclusions).
(2) Does the report fulﬁl the aims of the study?
(3) Does the title reflect the core of the problem studied?
(4) Have the observational. and reading background which .led to the hypotheses been given?
(5) Are the hypotheses and operational definitions of concepts specific and clear?
(6) Have the problem and hypotheses been stated in scientific terms?
(7) Is the chapter scheme relevant to the objectives of the study?
(8) Are the hypotheses tested appropriately and adequately?
(9) Are the findings and inferences clear and substantiated by data evidences?
(10) Are the conclusions effective, logical and based on the findings?
(11) Are the recommendations flow from the findings and conclusions? </p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000432">432</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:432
</h1>
<p>
(12) Are the recommendations specific, practical, weighty and convincing?
(13) Does the summary really summarize and point to further research?   </p>

<h1> Organization and Form </h1>
<p>
(14) Has the target audience been kept in mind?
(15) Is the division of the report into chapters and sections appropriate and logical?
(16) Is there a smooth development from the introduction to recommendations?
(17) Are there order and proportion in the paragraphs, sections and chapters?
(18) Are the quotations accurate?
(19) Is the technical information up-to-date?
(20) Have you given the techniques for the development of scales and indexes?
(21) Are the tables and charts accurate and self- contained?
(22) Are the footnotes complete and correct?   </p>


<h1> Language and Style </h1>

<p>
(23) Does the language conform to prevailing standard of usage?
(24) Is the presentation accurate, clear, crisp, logical and complete?
(25) Are the opening sentences of chapters, sections and paragraphs attractive?
(26) Is the style smooth and coherent?
(27) Is the expression strong, vigorous and dignified and free from grammatical and spelling
errors?
(28) Has every word been weighed and used for its exact meaning and function?
(29) Are the findings and arguments concise?
(30) Are there no jargons and vague words?
(31) Are you sure that you have done a good job, and are you, as your own critic, satisfied with
the report?
(32) Rectify the flaws, imperfections and weaknesses discovered in the course of the above
critical evaluation, and improve the presentation.
(33) Get the revised draft read by your colleagues/guide, as the case may be, and invite their
constructive criticism. It may be hard to take criticism, but as a researcher you must learn
to take it with open mind.
(34) Give each criticism serious, careful and objective attention.
(35) Revise the draft in the light of valid criticism and suggestions made by the readers.
</p>

<h1> Formal Stage </h1>

<p>
The final stage of the work consists of (a) Adding the following elements to the report:

(1) title page, (2) acknowledgement/preface, (3) table of contents, (4) list of tables and charts,
of bibliography and (6) appendices (See 12.4 Research Report Format, above) and (b) the final
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000433">433</pagenum>

<h1>
Page no:433
</h1>
<p>
editing of the revised and completed report. In the final editing, your attention should be focused on
the relationship between the original research questions and the report once more. Look at the
introduction and the conclusion. Are those sections adequate in every way? Did you stay on the track?
Are all investigative questions fully developed? Does the entire report read smoothly, with transitions
that carry the reader along from one idea to the next? Is the report complete in all respects? Are all
the elements — the title page, table of contents, list of tables and charts, bibliography and appendices
—— have been added? Are they complete and correct? Does the report justify the time, energy and
thought you have invested on it? If the answer to all these questions is “Yes”, your report is ready
for final proofreading.
</p>

<p>
Set aside the final draft for a few days, and then take it up for final reading with a freSher
outlook. Do not rush through. Read word by word. All data should be checked against the original,
and computations should be checked and cross-checked to ensure absolute accuracy. The sequence
of page numbers, table numbers, footnote numbers should be checked. The footnotes and biblio-
graphical entries should be checked carefully against the original. The correspondence of captions and
numbers of tables and charts in the text and in the list of tables and charts should be checked. Your
aim is to give finishing touches and correct all grammatical errors and deficiencies in punctuation
spelling, word choice, and sentence structure. Of course, there is no limit to perfection. One can get
on improving the report. Your final satisfaction and fulfilment that you had done all that you should
do to your report serves as an indicator to complete the work.
</p>
 <h1>
    12.8 TYPING THE REPORT   Introduction
</h1>

<p>
The final manuscript of the report should be given for typing preferably to a professional typis
with experience in typing research reports. The required number of multiple copies may be produced
either by the traditional method of typing an original and three or four carbon copies or by the modern
method of xeroxing multiple copies from a single original typed in an electronic typewriter. The late
method is preferable, because the quality of reproduction will be excellent.

The writer is expected to submit an accurate and acceptable draft to the typist. The final should
be correct in all grammatical conventions: capitalization, punctuation, spelling, compound words
hyphenation, and paragraphing. The writer should give clear instructions on requirements of margins
word division, indentions, documentation placement, spacing, headings, tables and charts, and quo
tations. The typist should use a new black medium-inked ribbon, superior grade black carbon sheet
and good quality bond papers.
 </p>

<h1>
    Typing Instructions
</h1>

<p>
Paper: Most universities require the thesis or dissertation typed on quality bond paper of sixteen
_ or twenty—pound weight and 8 1/2 x 11 inches in size. Only one side of the sheet should be typed

Margin: The left-side margin should not be less than 1 1/2 inches (or 40 mm), the right, top and
bottom margins one inch (or 25 mm).

Centering: The material on any page should be symmetrically arranged with reference to the
centre of the typed matter. To facilitate the proper placement of copy on the page a guide sheet may
be constructed, showing the proper margins, centre of the copy portion, and the number of lines from
 </p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000434">434</pagenum>
<h1>
Page no:434
</h1>

<p>
 the top and bottom margins. This sheet should be ruled in black ink and placed beneath the first sheet,
so that the markings show through.
 </p>

<p>
Spacing: The text of the thesis should be double - spaced and indented quotations and footnotes
should be single— spaced.
</p>

<p>
Words Division: When the division of word iS necessary to avoid great marginal unevenness,
the break should come between two syllables, for example, "thirty— six" rather than "thirty— six." Do
not divide words of one syllable. Do not also divide a word at the end of a page.
 </p>

<p>
Proper names: When there is occasion to use both given name and surname, or initials and
surname, they should preferably be all on the same line; very long names will, of course, require an
exception.
</p>

<p>
Indivisible items: Letters of a government agency, the dates, parts of an equation, monetary
expressions, and hours of the day should not be divided and run over to a second line; examples are

 </p>

<p>
Alignment of Numerals: Numericals are often arranged in vertical lists, and aligned on the
right side, for example, columns of figures should appear as follows:
                                     5
                                     8

                            </p>

<p>
Headings and titles: Chapter headings and Section headings should be capitalised and cen-
tered. Subdivision headings should be typed from the left-hand margin in lower-case and underlined.
A section within a chapter should normally be commenced on, a new page. The titles of appendices
should be capitalized and centered on the page. The titles of tables and charts should also be capi-
talised, centered and placed above the material to which they refer. </p>

 <p> Paragraphs should be indented seven spaces for pica type, nine for elite.  </p>
<p>
Tables, Graphs and Diagrams: They should be placed as near as possible to the text to which
they refer. Short tables can be included in the body of the text. The table number (e.g., TABLE
2.5)
should be separated from the text by two or three spaces. Two spaces below, the heading should be
typed in capitals. If an explanatory note to a time is necessary, an asterisk should be used. The note
should be placed immediately below the table. If the writer is quoting a table, the sourcer should be
indicated below the table preceded by the word ‘Source.’ </p>

<p>
Quotations: Direct quotations not over three typewritten lines in length are included in the
length are enclosed in quotation marks. Quotations of more than three lines are set off from the text
in a single—spaced paragraph and indented four spaces from both left and right margins without
quotation marks.

Footnotes: See Section 12.6, above.

Bibliography: See Section 12.6, above.

</h1>

<p>
Pagination: Pages of the text are numbered continuously in Arabic numerals; prefactory ma-
terial in small Roman numerals.  </p>

<p>
Corrections: Strikeovers, crossovers, insertions and erasures are not permitted. Corrections by
pen are never permissible. Either the error should be corrected on the typewriter, or the page should
be retyped. White correction fluid may be used for carrying out the corrections.  </p>


<h1> Proofreading </h1>

<p>
The typed script should be carefully read. This proofreading should consist of a word- by- word
search for misspelling, mispunctuation, and typing errors. All the errors should be corrected on the
typewriter, using correction fluid. Pages with noticeable erasures should be retyped. The final typed
script should be accurate, neat, clear and attractive.   </p>

<h1> Binding </h1>

<p>
The research students must consult department regulations relating to binding. Binding should
be neat and attractive. The writer should make sure the pages are in the correct order before copies
are sent to the binder.  </p>

                             <h1> 12.9 BRIEFING </h1>

<h1> Meaning </h1>

<p>
A researcher may have to present his research output in a ‘briefing.’ This involves-an oral
presentation of the lengthy complex report in a condensed summarized form. The presentation may
take 15 to 30 minutes followed by questions and discussion.  </p>

<h1> Situations </h1>

<p>
The briefing is generally made in the following situations:

1. A researcher may be asked to present his findings before the top executives of the organi-
zation which had sponsored the study; the executives are too busy to find time to studying a lengthy
written report. Hence they prefer to listen to the researcher’s brief oral presentation and interact with
him. This briefing is a presentation before user-executives with practical experience and expertise.

2. A doctoral student may be asked to give a seminar On his research in the Department before
the faculty, and other research students. He may be required to give this briefing while the study is
in progress and also later after the study is completed. In the first case he gets an opportunity to
receive valuable critical comments on his work and constructive‘ suggestions for improving it. In the
second case, he gets an opportunity to share his experience with his professors and co- researchers.
This type of briefing is an academic exercise.

3. A doctoral student is often asked by the viva-voce board to give a brief presentation about
his research work before questions are put to him. In this case the audience consists of expert
examiners, and other academicians and students as observers.  </p>

<h1> The Scope of Briefing </h1>

<p>
The scope of the briefing varies according to its situation and purpose. In the case of a briefing
before the executives of the sponsor-organisation, the focus of presentation will be on the conclusions
based on the findings and the recommendations. The user-executives may not be directly interested
  </p>

<p>
in the details of the methodology as such. Their primary concern is to determine the usefulness of the
results of the study to their decision making and planning. </p>
<p>
In an academic presentation, the focus will be on the entire research process in general and the
methodology in particular and on the contribution of the study to the wealth of knowledge. The
academic people are keenly interested in knowing the problem formulation and conceptualisation,
sampling, methods of, and tools for data collection, their validity and reliability and the plan of
analysis and the reliability of the findings.  </p>

<h1>
    Preparation
</h1>

<p>
A briefing requires a thorough preparation on the following lines:
1. Studying the expected audience: What do they expect to know from the study?
2. Finding the time available for presentation.
3. Anticipating the criticisms and the questions likely to be raised by the audience.
4. Developing an outline of the presentation:
 (i) introduction to state the nature of the study, how it came about and what it attempted
to do.
(ii) main ideas: conclusions based on findings and recommendations, if the audience con-
sists of user-executives; methodology, the research process and the results, if the audi—
ence consists of academic persons.
(iii) Concluding part.
5. Organizing the material for presentation.
6. Noting down the points in cards or a small (quarter -size) spiral note book.
7. Preparing the needed audio-visual aids in keeping with the needs and nature of the audience
in order to make the communication effective.
 </p>

<p>
The audio-visual aids may include transparencies for overhead projector, flow charts, slides and
videotapes.
 </p>

<p>
8. Anticipating briefing problems such as stage-fear, distracting mannerisms and the like, and
devising approaches to avoid them.
9. Rehearsing the entire briefing 3 or more times, and cutting the material, if necessary, to stay
within about 80% of the expected time allotted.
This would allow a time cushion for elaborating vital points and adding insights that might
arise at the moment.
10. Checking to see that all materials and aids are ready. The preparation on the above lines
would facilitate better presentation.
 </p>

<h1> Delivery </h1>

<p>
 A skilful presentation captivates the audience. The delivery should be regulated. The speed of
delivery, clarity of enunciation, pauses and gestures all play a part. The following guidelines deserve
consideration:   </p>

<p>
1.to reach the venue ahead of time
2.to arrange and set audio-visual aids
3.to start on time
4.to keep your eye contact with the audience
5.to speak loudly, clearly and slowly
6.to change the tone of your voice to keep the audience’s attention
7.to avoid showing nervous mannerism
8.to use visual aids for presenting models, sampling design, statistical tables, charts and
graphs
9. to complete the presentation on time
10.to answer questions appropriately and clarify points raised by the audience
11.to summarise main points and sum up aptly.
In short, a briefing should be planned carefully, organised well and presented effectively. Good
presentation adds luster to both the research and the researcher’s reputation.

    12.10 EVALUATION OF A RESEARCH REPORT Introduction
 </h1>

<p>
There are a few situations in which a research report may be evaluated or reviewed.

1. A doctoral research thesis or dissertation submitted to a university for award of Ph. D.
Degree is evaluated by a Board of examiners consisting of academic experts in the concerned field
of study. This evaluation aims at judging the research competence of the researcher —— how well he
planned and executed the study — and the contribution of his study to knowledge, policy and action
This evaluation embraces all aspects of the research process — from problem selection to reporting.
</p>

<p>
2. A critical analysis of research reports may be prescribed as an assignment to research stu-
dents. Research reports for this purpose may be selected from the published research reports, unpub-
lished theses or dissertations found in the university library, or research abstracts published in jour-
nals. Through a critical analysis of research reports, a student may gain some insight into the research
problem formulation, research designs, difficulties inherent in the research process, measurement
techniques, construction of data-gathering instruments, processing and analysis of data, interpretation
of results and the form, organization and presentation of the research report. </p>

<p>
3. Research promotion bodies like ICSSR are interested in the quality of reports of research
studies funded by them. They often refer the research reports to one or two references before releasing
the final instalment of the research grant. </p>

<p>
4. Many Ph. D. scholars seek from funding agencies like UGC, ICSSR, etc. financial assistance
for publishing their reports. A funding agency refers the reports submitted for publication grants to
experts for review and recommendation. This evaluation is meant for ascertaining whether the report
represents a significant contribution to knowledge and whether it is worthy of publication. </p>

<h1>
Evaluation Report, Page no: 440
</h1>
<p>
The evaluator has to give an evaluation report on the thesis or dissertation evaluated by him.
There is no standard format for this report. The evaluator is expected to comment on (I) the impor-
tance of the study; (2) soundness of the methodology; (3) quality of analysis; (4) significance of the
findings, and (5) format and style of presentation. It is not necessary for him to summarize the
contents of the thesis. But he must point out the strengths and weaknesses of the work. He should
give his final recommendation in clear terms —— the thesis be accepted or rejected. If the thesis needs
revision and resubmission, the evaluator recommends that the thesis be revised and resubmitted. In
this case, he should offer specific suggestions for the revision.
</p>

<h1>
Viva Voce Examination
</h1>

<p>
In most of the universities, a doctoral student is required to appear for an oral examination
conducted by a Board consisting of the chairman of the student’s Department, external examiners and
the research guide. The faculty members of the Department and research scholars may attend the
‘viva’ meeting as observers. In some universities the viva is open to public. Anybody present may
put questions to the doctoral student.
</p>

<p>
The student is expected to defend his thesis in the viva voce examination. This examination has
several purposes:
</p>

<p>
1. To establish the authenticity of the thesis, i.e., the student has in fact carried out the research
described in the thesis. (To this end he may be questioned closely on the problem formu-
lation, methodology and other aspects of the study);
2. To test the student’s knowledge of his subject;
3. To seek clarification or explanation from the student upon points made in the thesis; and
4. To provide the student with an opportunity to know the weaknesses and shortcomings of
his thesis. </p>

<p>
To prepare for the viva voce, the student should re-read the thesis, anticipate any points the
examiners are likely to make He should plan the defences to be offered for them. </p>

<p>
During the viva, the student should stay confident and relaxed. He should answer all questions
as fully and clearly as possible. But he should not, however, try to defend valid criticism. </p>

<p>
For a student who has carried out his research systematically and presented the results carefully,
the oral examination does not pose any problem. It may turn out to be a pleasant exchange of thoughts
between the student and experts in the field. </p>
