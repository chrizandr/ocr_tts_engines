	It is a matter of pride and joy that in the Intermediate ﬁrst year a course on ‘Ethics and Human
Values’ is being introduced from the academic year 2014-15. The BIE has always striven to update the

syllabus and make it more relevant to the needs of the society and interests of the students.
</p>

<p>
	The importance of the study of ethics and human values cannot be undermined. Ethics and
human values are not merely theoretical concepts but form an integral part of our culture and society.
The study of Ethics and Human Values text enables us to have a greater insight into the theory and
practice of moral conduct. We begin to appreciate the universality of human ethics and human values,

thoughts and behaviour and experience a close association With the rest of mankind.

</p>
<p>
	It is hoped that the new course will broaden the outlook of students and instil core values in

them, thereby making them upright individuals, responsible members of society and dutiful citizens of

the nation.
</p>

<p>
	We are indebted to the Principal Secretary (SE), and the Commissioner of Intermediate
Education who took an active interest in the progress of the text. Several renowned teachers have
worked painstakingly to bring the book to shape. All the team members of ERTW and DTP operators

deserve special mention of extending co-operation at all stages.
</p>

<p>
	I am sure that this new textbook will be received well. I look forward to feedback and

suggestions from parents, academicians and students so that the next edition can be further improved.

<p>

The role played by the Telugu Akademi in stabilizing Telugu Medium at the level of Higher
Education since its inception (1968) is well known. The Akademi has rendered needful services
by publising a number of Text Books, Reference Books, Translations, Popular Series,
Monographs, Dictionaries, Glossaries, Readings, etc., over the years. Many among the above
mentioned books were also reprinted as per the demand. Sincere effort is being made to improve
the quality of these books by conducting workshops, refresher Courses and also by taking
suggestions given by the intellectuals in general and the students and the teachers in particular.

</p>
<p>
	Akademi has been revising and updating its publications in accordance with the prescribed
syllabi, as and when necessary. Telugu Akademi is publishing Text Books for Intermediate in
Telugu Medium since its inception. From 1998 onwards the Telugu Akademi has entered a new
phase of activity with the Board of Intermediate Education entrusting the work of preparation
and publication of Intermediate Text Books in English Medium.
</p>

<p>
	For the academic year 2014 - 2015, the Board of Intermediate Education has revised the
syllabus of all Humanities Text Books for Ist year of lntermediate. For the First time BIE has
decided to prepare the English medium Humanities Text Books. As a result, the BIE on its own
prepared the content of the First year Intermediate English medium Text Books of the Humanities
subjects i.e., Commerce, Economics, Accountancy, Civics, History, Public Administration,
Psychology, Logic, Geography, Geology, Philosophy, Home Science, Ethics and Human Values.
The Akademi is further entrusted with the task of printing and distribution of the all Intermediate
Humanities Books.

</p>
<p>
	Telugu Akademi is also bringing out Telugu medium Humanities Text Books for the beneﬁt
of Telugu medium students of Intermediate level ﬁom the academic year 2014-2015 onwards.
</p>

<p>
	We are indeed very much grateful to the Government of India, the Government of Andhra
Pradesh, Goverment of Telangana, Universities, the Board of Governors of the Telugu Akademi,
NCERT and the Board of Intermediate Education. We also thank the Secretary of the Board of
Intermediate Education and Commissioner of Intermediate Education. We are also very much
grateful to Text Book Development Committee of the concerned for their invaluable cooperation.

	Preface,page no : 8
</h1>

<p>
	The advent of industrialisation, modernisation, urbanisation and
computerisation have brought about changes not only in the society and culture
but made a lasting impact on the family system. The size of the family got reduced
to 3—4 members from 8-10 that was a norm some 50 years ago. Combined family
system made way to nuclear, loose and less-interactive families. Grandparents
and their grandchildren see one another mostly during some family or social functions.
Children learn how to walk & talk mostly from the electronic gadgets, cartoon and
movie channels. Socialisation is mostly on the so-called social networks like FB,
Twitter, Orkut etc., of the internet. The generation gap is widening at a faster pace.
</p>
<p>

Grandma stories with morals, moral education classes in the School time-
tables have vanished. Ethical and human values are acquired mostly through informal
learning or sometimes in non-formal settings. There is no scope for observational
learning in the present—day, fast changing society.

</p>
<p>
	In order to slowdown the process of erosion of human values, promote
awareness of youth to participate in the development of the nation and to impart
skills to the students in their formative stage this course on Ethics and Human
Values has been introduced at the Intermediate level of education. The units have
been illustrated with photos, ﬁgures, tables in order to make them more interesting
to read. Activities have been incorporated wherever possible. The material has
been presented in a self-learning format for the students to study on their own,
understand and improve their personality.
</p>

<p>
	We welcome any constructive suggestions for quality improvement ofthis
book.

<p>

1.1 Deﬁnition of Ethics and Human Values
1.2 The Nature of Values
1.3 Good Behaviour and Respect for Elders
1.1 DEFINITION OF ETHICS AND HUMAN VALUES

</p>
 <p>

Ethics may be deﬁned as the Study of what is right or good in conduct. It is the general
theory of conduct and considers the actions of human beings with reference to their rightness or
wrongness, their tendency to good or to evil. The term Ethics is derived from the Greek source etos
meaning character, custom or habit, Similarly, the term Moral Philosophy, which means the samething
as Ethics, is derived from the Latin ‘mores' meaning habits or customs. Ethics, then, we may say,is a
study of the habits and customs, of men and the principles on which these habits and actions are
based. It is a study of what constitutes the rightness or wrongness of those principles and the good or
evil of those habits. The terms Right and Good require some explanation.
</p>
<p>

The term Right is derived ﬁom the Latin rectus, meaning straight or according to rule. The
Greek word corresponding to it is sikalos, which also meant originally, according to rule.When we
say that conduct is right, We mean primarily that it is according to rule. Rules, however, have reference
to some result to be achieved by them; and it is this fact that is indicated by the second term, “Good.”
</p>
<p>

The term Good is connected to the German gut, and contains the same root as the Greek
ayatos. A thing is generally said to be good when it is valuable for some end. Thus, particular kinds of
medicine are said to be good for this or that complaint. Similarly, when we speak of conduct as good,
 we mean that it is serviceable for the end or ideal that we have in View. It should be carefully observed,
however, that the term “good “is also used (perhaps even more frequently) to signify not something
which is a means to an end, but something which is itself taken as an end.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00012">12</pagenum>
<h1>
	page no : 12
</h1>
<p>

Now there are many ends to which our actions may be directed, e.g. the building of a house,
the writing of a book, the passing of an examination, and so on. But since Ethics is the study of conduct
as a whole, and not of any particular kinds of conduct, it is not any of these special ends that it sets itself
to consider, but the supreme or ultimate end to which our whole lives are directed. This end is
commonly referred to as the SummumBonum or Supreme Good.
</p>

<p>
	It is no doubt open to question at the outset whether there can be said to be any one supreme
end in human life. Men aim at various objects. Some desire wealth; others, independence; others,
power. Some are eager for fame; others, for knowledge; others, for love; and some again ﬁnd their
highest good in loving and serving others.
</p>

<p>
	But a little consideration serves to show that many of these ends cannot be regarded as
ultimate. If, for instance, we were to questiOn those who are seeking wealth or independence or power,
we would generally ﬁnd that they would explain their desire for these objects by enumerating the
advantages which the attainment of the desired objects would bring. The possibility of such an explanation
proves that these objects are not regarded as ultimate ends by those who pursue them, but are desired
for the sake of something else. It is necessary for us to assume that there is some ideal in life,i.e. that
there is some standard of judgement by preference to which we are able to say that one form of
conduct is better than another. Thus, Ethics is the science or general study of the ideal involved in
human life.
</p>

	<h1>

1.1.1 The Nature of Ethics

1.1.1.1 Ethics is a Normative Study
</h1>
<p>

The fact that Ethics is concerned with an end or ideal or standard serves at once to distinguish
it from most of the special sciences.

Most sciences are concerned with certain uniformities of our experience—with the ways in
which certain classes of objects (such as rocks or plants) are found to exist, or with the ways in which
certain classes of events (such as the phenomena of sound or electricity) are found to occur. Such
sciences have no direct reference to any end that is to be achieved or to any ideal by reference to which
the facts are judged. The knowledge which they communicate may, indeed, be useful for certain purposes.
Knowledge about rocks is useful for those who wish to build houses or to sink mines. Knowledge
about electricity is useful for those who wish to protect their buildings or to send telegraphic
communications. But the truth of the sciences that deal with such subjects as these is in no way affected
by the ends which they may thus be made to sub-serve. Knowledge about the nebulae is as much a part
of the science of astronomy as knowledge about the solar system, though the latter can be directly
turned to account in the art of navigation, while the former has no direct practical utility.
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00013">13</pagenum>


<h1>
	page no : 13
</h1>


<p>
	The study of Ethics, then, is distinguished from the natural sciences, in as much as it has a
direct reference to an end that men desire to attain, or a type to which they wish to approximate.
</p>
<p>

There are at least two other subjects, commonly recognised as scientiﬁc, that are in a similar
position viz., Logic and Aesthetics. These are concerned, respectively, with the general conditions
involved in the pursuit of Truth and in the creation and appreciation of Beauty, just as Ethics is concerned
with what is good and right in human purposes and actions. Such studies are sometimes said to be
normative. Normative studies are concerned with standards of value, rather than with the simple
apprehension and analysis of what exists or occurs.

</p>
<h1>
	1.1.1.2 Ethics is not a Practical Science
</h1>
<p>

In view of the fact that Ethics is concerned with action, it has sometimes been characterized as
a practical science; but this is, on the whole, misleading. There are some scientfic studies that may
rightly be characterised as practical, such as Medicine, Engineering or Architecture. Such studies are
directed towards the realization of a deﬁnite result. Ethics, as a theoretical study, differs from this ,just as Logic and Aesthetics do. Logic deals with the general conditions involved in the discovery and appreciation of Beauty.
 In like manner, Ethics deals with the general conditions involved in the rightness
or goodness of conduct.

</p>
<p>
	In all these cases it is true that reﬂection on the principles involved may be expected to help us
in their application. One who has studied Logic may be expected to think more accurately than he
otherwise would. One who has studied Aesthetics may be expected to have a ﬁner appreciation of
beauty, nature and art than he would otherwise possess. So also one who studies Ethics ought to have
a ﬁner moral discernment and a more zealous and discriminating pursuit of What is right and good than
one would otherwise have had.
</p>
<p>

But, after careful consideration we can conclude that it is not true that it is the object of
Aesthetics to qualify students to be artists or of Ethics to qualify them to be saints. The student of Ethics

is likely to learn more ﬁom the saint or hero than the latter will learn from him. So, it can be said that the

object of those studies that are described as normative is to supply a knowledge of guiding principles
rather than to explain how they are to be applied.
</p>

<h1>
	 1.1.2 Character and Conduct
</h1>
<p>

Though character and conduct are related, it is interesting to observe the differences from the
point of v1ew of Ethics.

</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00014">14</pagenum>

<h1>
	 page no: 14
	 1.1.2.1 Character
</h1>

<p>
	Character means the complete universe or system constituted by acts of will of a particular Kind. Character is, on the  whole , the most important element in life from the point of view of Ethics.
</p>
<p>

The accidental dominance of a good purpose at this or that moment is of comparatively little
consequence unless it is an indication of the habitual dominance of a certain universe. Hence Aristotle
rightly laid emphasis on the formation of character by Good Habit— i.e. on the establishment of a
continuously dominant universe rather than on the mere presence of a Good Will at any given moment.
Good will is, indeed, the expression of Character, but it is the expression under the limitations of a
particular time and space; and much may remain latent in the character which it would be necessary to
take into account in forming a complete moral estimate of a given individual.
</p>

<h1>
	1.1.2.2 Conduct
</h1>
<p>

 The term conduct is sometimes used in a loose sense to include all sorts of vital activities, or, at any rate all vital activities which are directed to an end.
</p>
<p>

Although the activities of animals are no doubt adjusted to an end, we cannot regard them as
purposeful activities. A purposeful activity is not merely directed to an end, but, directed by the idea of
an end. Now even the higher animals, in so far as they are guided by mere instinct, cannot be supposed
to have any such idea. They move towards certain ends, but they do not ‘will’ these ends. They have
an end, but they have not purposed.
</p>
<p>

Purposeless acts are not to be included in conduct. Hence it seems best to confine the term
 conduct to those acts that are not merely adjusted to ends, but also definitely willed. A person’s conduct
then, is the complete system of such acts, corresponding to his character.
</p>

<h1>
	1.1.2.3 Habit
</h1>
<p>
	The significance of Habit has already been to some extent indicated in connection with character,
and, in particular, reference has been made to Aristotle's view that the main focus in moral life is the establishment of good habits. This view was put forward by Aristotle 1n opposition to the Socratic
doctrine that Virtue is a kind of Knowledge. Yet the two views are not so much opposed as might at ﬁrst sight appear.
</p>
<p>
	Virtue is a kind of knowledge, as well as a kind of habit. It is, in fact, as we have already
indicated, a point of view. The virtuous man is one who lives continuously in the universe which is constituted
by duty. To live continuously in that universe is a habit; but it is at the same time a species of insight. To be
virtuous, therefore, is to possess habitually a certain kind of knowledge or insight. And thus both Socrates
and Aristotle were right. Virtue is both a kind of knowledge and a kind of habit.
</p>

 1.2 THE NATURE OF VALUES
</h1>
<p>

 Understanding the nature of values is complicated both by the fact many different kinds of values exist
 and that multitudes of confusions about values, many resulting from false ideas, exist. Sifting
through the multifarious kinds of values may seem like a hopeless task for beginners.
</p>

<h1>
	 1.2.1 Good and Bad
</h1>
<p>

The distinction between good and bad is so obvious that it does not merit detailed explanation.
One can safely assume that all adults, at least, know how to distinguish between good and bad.
</p>

<p>
	 The distinction between good and bad is so fundamental that it is basic to all other discussions about value.

 Any value theory failing to recognize the distinction between good and bad is not merely
inadequate but it is false. Persons distinguishing between good and bad do not all have the same
conceptions of good or bad or of how they are related. Yet some minimum of general statements can be
made about good and bad.
</p>

<h1>
	1.2.1.1 Good and Bad are opposites
</h1>
<p>

Good is not bad. Bad is not good. Although some persons mistakenly interpret existing
opposites as contradictories, good and bad are noncontradictory opposites. Contradictory opposites
have nothing in common. Good and bad have something in common. Both are values. Both are alike in
being values. Their likeness in both being values is inherent in their nature. Thus good and bad are

 unlike in some respects and alike in others. The variable character of good and bad is embedded in our
language in the words good, better, best and bad, worse, worst.
</p>

<h1>
	1.2.1.2 Good and bad are equally important
</h1>
<p>

Good and bad are equally important as ingredients in an adequate theory of values. Both
 good and bad exist. Every person experiences both good and bad. Some persons experience more
good than bad during a day, a year and a lifetime. Probably some persons experience more bad than
good, during a day, a year, and a lifetime. Persons naturally aim to maximize good and to minimize bad,
and, if they are intelligent, to do so on all occasions where they have a choice and sufficient influence.
Sometimes expositions of the nature of values are facilitated by emphasizing bad. One may even rightly
idealize elimination of all bad and of achieving experience of only good, even only the best. But, since
good and bad seem to us to be equally important constituents of experience, We propose as a hypothesis
that they are. We do not say that each life is equally good and bad, but only that good and bad are
equally significant as constituents in every life.

1.3 GooD BEHAVIOUR AND RESPECT For ELDERS

 </h1>
<p>

 Discipline and good behaviour should develop from within the child. Children should be
encouraged to develop self-discipline, rather than to follow a set of imposed rules, and should be

allowed to learn what appropriate behaviour is and to take responsibility for their own choices. For this
parents should  encourage independence, develop children's self-esteem , encourage consideration and care for others, promote honesty and trust
 and provide clearly deﬁned and consistent boundaries.
Further, parents should act as role models who demonstrate the attributes they wish to encourage in and consequences.

 Time should be allocated to discuss issues relating to conduct and behaviour. It is
also necessary to provide an exciting and stimulating environment for learning. Children should be
taught to respect elders.

</p>
<h1>
	1.3.1 Respect for Elders in the present-day society

</h1>

<p>

Respect your Elders is one of the basic lessons of our childhood days. When we ask the
reason, most of the time we receive answers like ‘It’s good manners,’ or ‘I am an elder so you should
listen to me. ’Let us look at some of the reasons why we should respect elders.
</p>

<p>
	Let us imagine you are travelling in a bus or train, and you sit comfortably through the journey
while elders stand all the way for hours on end. Is this the future you would wish for yourself? Is this
how you want your life to be when you grow old? As you sow, so shall you reap! Being disrespected
by the younger generation is humiliating. So let us not do to elders that which we do not want to be done
to us when we get old. Respect begets respect. Let us invest respect now to insure respect later in life.
</p>

Pushing an elder to get a better seat or to grab the last piece of something is never worth it for
it never feels right. We gladly help a child when he is about to fall, because he cannot care for himself.
The same thing applies to seniors. Humanity is another reason to respect elders. We all share a bond as
human beings. As a child we are helped at every stage by people we know and don’t know. Children
cannot survive without the care and support of adults. Just as we instinctively protect children, in the
same way it is our duty to take care of our elders. When elders face health problems, the more able
bodied generation should shoulder the responsibility as it is their duty to do so. It is a payback for the
safe childhood one has enjoyed and also hope for assisted old age for oneself when the time comes.
</p>
<p>

The saying ‘wisdom is in the eyes and eyes give away the age’ is true. This is another reason
to respect elders for they have seen it all. The present phase of our life has already been experienced
by them, they know what we are going through and they can guide us through the unknown.

Mountaineers have the most experienced person leading the team from the front so that the amateurs
behind can step correctly and do not hurt themselves or kill themselves. As experts have a wealth of

<p>
	knowledge and experience we should learn from them and respect them. Life is too short if we use the
‘try and learn’ method. Playing smart in every field is important. Not using the living breathing
knowledge bank of seniors is stupidity. We have an amazing asset in the rich experience of our elders,
so let us turn to them for their invaluable advice and guidance.
</p>
<p>

Our elders love us; they want the best for us. We have to keep in mind the generation gap and
meet them halfway to understand them. We should respect people who love us and care for our well
being. We are the children whom the elders have raised selflessly. It is only fair that they have a say in
our life. We have the responsibility to be grateful to them for all the sacrifices have made for us. The
least we can do is respect them.
</p>
<p>

Indian weddings are replete with rituals in which elders play a major role. These rituals have
deep meaning and without elders we would be lost, to say the least! Traditions are best understood and

implemented by the more experienced members of society. Every family has that special recipe which

others just can’t get right; it may have been handed down through generations. Elders are integral to the

heritage of our family and are the gatekeepers to endless family treasures and it is only befitting that we
always respect the gatekeeper.
</p>
<p>

Family hiStory and traditions are no less fascinating than a classic movie. We love to hear tales
from our elders about the interesting incidents and experiences of their youth. Who doesn’t like to hear
stories about their father as a strong teenage boy and their mother as a shy teenage girl, their grandfather
as a proud freedom ﬁghter and grandmother as the archetypal housewife? The family tree gives us a
sense of identity as to where we come from, who we are and how we became what we are. We feel
more rooted in the world and gain conﬁdence and a feeling of self-worth. We should be grateful to our

forebears for the rich traditions they have passed down to us.

</p>
<p>
	Elders are the ones who teach the youngsters. Whatever we learn is from them and them

alone. If we have a sound value system and morals, if we can instinctively tell what is wrong and what
 is right, we shoud thank our elders from Whom we have learnt all this. Society is lika a building. If the

base is shaky the building won’t survive. Our elders are the pillars of society and we should be grateful
to them for their indomitable spirit and guidance. A man is judged by his character and character is

 moulded by the elders. So it is one of the simplest and strongest reasons to respect elders. They look
after us when we are sick, cook for us, care for us, talk to us, teach us, and love us more than life itself.
We reciprocate their love; we follow their teachings and their words.They show us their love by acts of
kindness and care, we show our love by offering them respect. The touching of feet of elders in India is

not just a rule; it is a symbol of our love. Respect is part of love, love doesn’t exist without respect and
respect is one of the many signs of love. We can let elders know we care by respecting their words and

 actions. This will strengthen our relationship with them and trust will multiply in no time. Life becomes

easier for us when we have our elders on our side during our struggles.

Teenage is a period of confusion and tension. Blessed is the teen to have an experienced
person to guide him through it all. Elders can empathise with the conflicts and dilemmas of youngsters as
they too had passed through a similar phase and they are well equipped to offer sound advice. They
know personally what it feels like to be in love, to be indecisive about life, to be confronted with peer
pressure, to face a crisis in the family and so on. Elders can truly be one’s friend, philosopher and guide.
The puzzles of life can be daunting but elders are like a key that solves all puzzles.
</p>

<p>
	A player deserves a reward after splendid race. The reward justifies the achievement and is
an acknowledgement of appreciation. Our elders have run a long race, they have won and, therefore,
we should respect them. Life would be tasteless without appreciation. We should not respect elders
just because we must. Rather, we should respect them because we want to. A new member of a team
follows a legacy and later becomes the flag bearer. This life cycle works only if it is based on respect.
Therefore, you should

. Listen to their advice: Your elders have lived a lot longer than you, which means they
have probably experienced more and have grown very wise. Listen to them as they may

offer a new perspective to a problem or give a piece of sound practical advice.

. Offer to help: Elders will appreciate any assistance you are Willing to give them. Offer to
 help carry groceries in or hold a door open for them. The act may be simple but comes
straight from the heart.

. Observe manners and etiquette: A simple ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ can mean a lot.
Always be polite and sincere.

. Entertain them. Elders deserve relaxation and entertainment after working hard all through
their life. Instead of leaving them to spend time alone in front of the television set, try to

engage them in conversation and involve them in activities they may enjoy.

. Show an interest in their life: Ask them about their childhood, or how things were in the

past. They will be happy that you are interested, and will be glad to regale you with interesting
anecdotes and stories.

. Be a friend: Offer to read to them, or maybe even have a cup of coffee together. It would
be enjoyable for both.

. Be patient. With age, people sometimes lose their mental faculties or may become slow in

their responses. It is necessary, therefore, to show compassion and patience while dealing
with elders.

<h1>
	 2.1 INDIAN CONSTITUTION AND VALUES
</h1>

<p>

 The constitution of a country is a document which contains the broad framework of fundamental
principles according to which the country will be governed. It lays down the structure, procedures, powers
and duties of a government and also the rights and duties of citizens. The constitution of India is the

world’s lengthiest written constitution With 395 articles and 8 schedules. The Constituent Assembly of
 India was formed in 1946. All the important national leaders of the Indian National Movement were

members of the Constituent Assembly. The task of the Constituent Assembly was to frame the Indian
Constitution. A Drafting committee was formed under the chairmanship of Dr.B.R.Ambedkar. The New
Constitution of India was adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 26th November 1949 and came into
force on 26th January 1950. 26th January is celebrated as Republic Day every year.
</p>

<p>
	The Preamble to the Constitution of India is a brief introductory statement that Spells out the
guiding principles of the document. The Preamble states that India is a sovereign,

socialist, secular, democratic republic. The words “socialist” and “secular” were added in 1976 by an amendment. The word ‘Sovereign’ emphasizes that India has its own defined territory and is free of
any foreign power. In a democratic republic the supreme power is vested in the citizens who vote for

their representatives in fair and free elections. The power is not vested in a monarch or hereditary head

	of state. In a socialist state all decisions are made according to the wishes of the majority and according

 to established laws. In a secular country the government does not interfere in matters pertaining to
religion. People of all religions have the right to practise their faith.
</p>

 <p>
	The Constituent Assembly laid down some ideals in the Indian constitution. The ideals aim to
 promote justice, liberty, equality and fraternity among all Indians in the following aspects:

Justice:  Political justice, economic justice and social justice is guaranteed to all Indians.
Liberty: Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship is guaranteed to all citizens.
Equality: All Indians are assured of equality of status and opportunity.
Fraternity: The Indian constitution enshrines the notion of ‘fraternity’ i.e. a feeling of
brotherhood amongst all Indians. It strives to establish dignity of the individual
along with the unity and integrity of the nation.

</p>
 <p>
	The Indian constitution was drafted keeping in View that India has different languages, religions
and cultures. It was recognized that ‘unity in diversity’ is essential for peace and harmony.


</p>

<h1>
	2.2 FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
</h1>
<p>
	Fundamental rights of citizens are the cornerstone of democracy. They are basic human freedoms
which all Indian citizens have the right to enjoy such that they can lead a life of peace and harmony. The
rights are protected by the courts. The rights protect the interests of minorities and promote unity,
 justice and morality among people.
The Fundamental Rights are as follows:

</p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page00022">22</pagenum>

<p>
	This right provides equal opportunity in matters of public employment. Untouchability is
prohibited through this right.

</p>
<p>
	Right to equality abolishes titles except military and academic distinctions like Bharat Ratna, Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan, Padma Sri, Veer Chakra and Ashok Chakra. These titles are presented by the President of India but they cannot be prefixed or suffixed to the names of the recepients as a matter of course.
</p>
<h1>
	2.2.2 Right to Freedom
</h1>
<p>
	Liberty is a vital element of democracy. Right to Freedom refers to:

a. freedom of speech and expression with certain restrictions, freedom of press

b. freedom to assemble peacefully without arms

prohibits trafﬁc in human beings for purposes of slavery and prostitution. However, the state can impose

compulsory service without any discrimination for public purpose.
</p>
<p>

Right against exploitation also means that children below 14 years of age shall not be employed to
work in factories or mines or in any other hazardous occupation. In fact, child labour in any form is prohibited.
</p>

<h1>
	2.2.4 Right to Religion
</h1>
<p>

India is a land in which diverse religions are followed. So this right is particularly
significant.

freedom to propagate any religion subject to public order. No person can be compelled to pay any tax meant for
promoting any particular religion. No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution
wholly maintained out of state funds.

</p>
<h1>

</p>

<h1>
	2.2.6 Right to Constitutional Remedies
</h1>
<p>
	This is a special fundamental right. It protects the remaining rights. If any fundamental right is violated either by the state or by any person, one can move the High Court or the Supreme Court and seek protection. Laws made by the government can be declared unconstitutional and invalid if they
violate fundamental rights Dr.B.R.Ambedkar called this right the “soul of the Indian Constitution”.

</p>
<h1>
	 2.2.7 Right to have Compulsory Primary Education for all children
</h1>

<p>
	This Right was included in 2002 through an amendment. Under this right, children from 6 to 14 years of age should be provided free and compulsory education by the government. 25% allocation of seats is compulsory to the weaker sections even in private schools.
</p>

 <h1>
	2.3 FUNDAMENTAL DUTIES
</h1>

<p>
	Fundamental rights and duties are like the two sides of a coin. Without performing duties, no citizen can enjoy fundamental rights. Conversely there can be no duties without rights. Rights originated from the world of duties. Fundamental duties were not incorporated in the constitution in 1950 because the members of Constituent Assembly assumed that the people themselves would invariably perform their duties. But the assumption was incorrect. Hence fundamental duties were introduced in the Constitution by the 42nd amendment act in 1976 to make citizens realize their responsibilities. The delineation of Fundamental Duties was inspired by the constitution of the erstwhile Soviet Union. Unlike Fundamental Rights, Fundamental Duties are not enforceable by law. It is left to the goodwill of Citizens
 to abide by the provisions. Citizens are required to observe the following:

1. To abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag
and theNational Anthem

2. To cherish and follow the noble ideals which inspired our national struggle for freedom
3. To uphold and protect the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India

4. To defend the country and render national service when called upon to do so

5. To promote harmony and spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of
India transcending diversities, to renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women
6. To value and preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture

7. To value and preserve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife
and to have compassion for living creatures

8. To develop the scientific temper, humanism and the spirit of inquiry and reform

9. To safeguard public property and abjure violence

</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00024">24</pagenum>

<p>
	10. To strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activity, so that
the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement

11. To accommodate educational facilities to all children from 6 to 14 years
</p>

<p>
	Some people are of the opinion that fundamental duties are not justiﬁable. But rights without I
duties may lead to an irresponsibile attitude among people. At the same time duties without rights paves
the way to slavery. Hence fundamental rights and duties are both necessary. Every Indian citizen should
lead a responsible and disciplined life by performing the duties enshrined in the constitution. He can then
enjoy the rights to become an ideal citizen, who can serve himself, his family, his society and thereby the
whole nation. Thus both rights and duties are essential for the upliftment of the nation.

</p>

<h1>

2.4 DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY
</h1>
<p>
	Directive Principles of State Policy are the directions giVen by the Constitution to the government
to bring about economic and social justice by means of suitable policies and legislation. They act like a
beacon to the government. These guidelines have been inspired by the Directive Principles enshrined 1n
the Irish constitution and also by the principles of Gandhianism. The Principles do not merely deal with
administrative and legal matters but emphasize the need and methods to ensure economic prosperity
and social justice of citizens, besides dealing with foreign policy.
</p>

<h1>
	2.4.1 The Important Directive Principles of State Policy
</h1>

<p>
1. Equal pay for equal work for both men and women; maternity facilities and mother-

child welfare association for pregnant women

2. Protection of children and youth from exploitation; arrangement of educational facilities

for children below 6 years
3. Distribution of ownership and control of the material resources of the community to

serve the common good arrangement of adequate means of livelihood and promotion

 of people's health

4. Promotion of educational and economic interests of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes,
physically challenged people, old people and orphans
5. Organizing village Panchayats and endowing them with power of self-government;

establishment of cottage industries in villages

6. Uniform civil code for citizens i.e. inequality of all kinds based on status, religion,
opportunity, income and facility must be abolished

7. Decentralization of national Wealth to all the people; abolition of social inequality and
protection of weaker sections
</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page00025">25</pagenum>

<p>
8. Protection and improvement of enviromnent and safe guarding of forests and wild life;
organization of agriculture and animal husbandry

9. Promotion of International peace and security
10. Promotion of literacy among people, irrespective of age

</p>
<p>
	The goals of Justice, Liberty and Equality can be achieved only when all Indians are able to
fulfill basic needs like food, clothes and shelter. All citizens should be given equal status and the opportunity
to participate in decision making. Universal Adult Franchise is a means of empowering people and
 ensuring political justice for all. Directive Principles of state policy ensure that the government provides
opportunities and liberty to people to achieve fulfillment of social and economic goals.
</p>
<h1>
	 2.5 OUR NATIONAL EMBLEM
</h1>
<p>
The National Emblem of India has been taken from the Sarnath Lion
 Pillar erected by Emperor Ashoka. The national emblem of India was adopted by
the Government of India on 26th January1950. In the National emblem only
 three lions are visible, while the fourth one is hidden from view. All the lions are
mounted on an abacus. At the centre of the abacus there is a Chakra (wheel)
which symbolizes the Dharma Chakra (Eternal wheel of law).
</p>
<p>
	There is a bull, a galloping horse, an elephant and a lion, separated by
intervening wheels over a bell shaped lotus. The words Satyameva Jayate (Truth alone triumphs)
have been inscribed 1n the Devanagari script. This saying, drawn from the Mundaka Upanishad, was
adopted as the National motto of India. The National emblem of India is the ofﬁcial seal of the President
of India. The emblem appears prominently on Indian currency and passports. The National emblem is
used only for official purposes and commands the highest respect and loyalty. It is also a symbol of
 independent India’s identity and sovereignty.

</p>
<h1>
	3.1 DESIRABLE BASIC HUMAN QUALITIES
</h1>
<p>
	Character is the comprehensive set of ethical and intellectual dispositions of a person. It is
said “Character maketh a man.” It is not enough for youngsters to receive an educational degree and
get a good job. It is imperative that they also develop a good character and imbibe ethical values. Only

then can they be ideal members of society.
</p>

<p>
	According to the World Health Organization, healthy people are those who are both mentally
and physically healthy. Youth should strive to create a healthy nation by being healthy and practising
good habits. They Should join NSS, NCC and participate in Blood Donation Camps. They should
follow good food habits and inculcate good qualities. They Should avoid bad habits like consuming
alcohol and taking drugs.
</p>

<p>
	Adolescents do not have the required experience to face societal challenges. They may not
know how to handle a certain situation. They may face tremendous academic pressure, for instance,
and feel crushed. They may ﬁnd it difficult to resist peer pressure. Under such circumstances they may
fall into depression or indulge in socially deviant behaviour. It is necessary, therefore, for teens to
develop good qualities like discipline, courage of conviction and self-confidence. One way of building
a good system of values is to choose a role model either from the family or society. Youngsters can also
seek inspiration from the study of biographies of great leaders, social reformers, revolutionaries, scientists

and educationists. Gradually they can develop a set of core moral values which will hold them in good

<p>

stead. They can channelise their energy in constructive activities like social work, instead of indulging in
ragging and eve-teasing. A good character can help them to achieve laurels in life.
</p>

<h1>
	3.1.1 Honesty
</h1>
<p>
	Honesty connotes positive and virtuous attributes such as integrity, truthfulness, and
 straightforwardness, along with the absence of lying, cheating, theft, etc. Furthermore, honesty means
being trustworthy, loyal, fair, and sincere.Honesty is valued in many ethnic and religious cultures.

</p>
<h1>
	 3.1.2 Truthfulness
</h1>

<p>
	The word Satya (Truth) is derived from Sat, which means ‘being’. Nothing is or exists in

 reality except Truth. Wherever there is Truth, there is also knowledge which is true. When there is no
 Truth, there can be no true knowledge. And where there is true knowledge, there is always bliss

(Ananda). There sorrow has no place. And even as Truth is eternal, so is the bliss derived from it.

Hence we know god as Sat-Chit—Ananda, one who combines in Himself Truth, Knowledge and Bliss.
</p>
<p>

Devotion to Truth is the sole justification for existence. All our activities should be entrenched

 in Truth. Truth should be the very breath of our life. Without truth it is impossible to observe any principles or rules in life.
</p>
<p>

Generally speaking, observation of Truth is understood merely to mean that we must speak

 the truth. But we must understand the word Satya in a much wider sense. There should be Truth in

thought, Truth in speech, and Truth in action. Truth is the cornerstone of Gandhian philosophy. Every
page of Gandhiji’s autobiography testifies to the lore of truthfillness.
</p>

<h1>
	3.1.3 Humility
</h1>
<p>

Humility cannot be learnt through formal training, but it grows by itself as one cultivates the

 spirit of nonviolence. Outward humility of behaviour can be learnt in a formal manner. However, it is not

true humility, but only cultured manners. In humility one has to forget the sense of “I” and become a

mere cipher (zero). Humble people are modest and do not boast about their achievements.
</p>

<h1>
	 3.1.4 Punctuality
</h1>

<p>
	Punctuality is the characteristic of being able to complete a required task or fulfill an obligation

before or at a previously designated time.
</p>
<p>

  Some cultures have an unspoken understanding that actual deadlines are different from stated

deadlines; for example, it may be understood in a particular culture that people will turn up an hour later
than advertised. In this case, since everyone understands that a 9 AM meeting will actually start at

around 10AM, no-one is inconvenienced when everyone arrives at 10 AM.

</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00028">28</pagenum>
      <h1>
	       page no : 28
</h1>
<p>
	In cultures which value punctuality, being late is seen as disrespectful of others’ time and may
be considered insulting. In such cases, punctuality may be enforced by social penalties, for example by excluding latecomers from meetings entirely.
</p>

<h1>
	3.1.5 Responsibility
</h1>
<p>

A responsibility is a duty or obligation to satisfactorily perform or complete a task (assigned
by someone, or created by one’s own promise or circumstances) that one must fulfill, and which has
a consequent penalty for failure. A responsibility or an obligation is a course of action that someone is
required to take, whether legal or moral. There are also obligations in other contexts, such as obligations
of etiquette, social obligations, and possibly in terms of politics, where obligations are requirements
which must be fulfilled. These are generally legal obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfillment, although certain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as well, whether as a tradition or for social reasons. Obligations vary from person to person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have far more obligations than an average adult citizen, who himself will have more obligations than a child. Obligations are generally granted in return for an increase in an individual’s rights or power.
</p>
<h1>
	3.1.6 Courtesy
</h1>
<p>

Courtesy comes from old French ‘courteis’ which means gentle or polite. In Europe, the
behaviour expected of the nobility was compiled in courtesy books. In India too, nobility and royalty were expected to display courteous behaviour. The concept was described by the Sanskrit word daksinya, which meant kindness and consideration expressed in a sophisticated and elegant way.

</p>
<h1>
	3.1.7 Discipline
</h1>
<p>
	The highest form of freedom carries with it the greatest measure of discipline. Man must
follow rigid discipline before he can achieve anything great. Enduring discipline does not come by mere academic argument and appeal to reason and logic. Discipline is learnt in the school of adversity.
</p>
<p>
	Youth fall easy prey to vices. They are helplessly and thoughtlessly drawn to Vices. They must
realize the harm that can ensue. They must understand that nothing but a rigorously disciplined life will save them.
</p>
<p>

Duties, according to Dr.Radhakrishnan, are opportunities offered to man to sink his
separate self and grow out into the world. Therefore, every individual must subdue his senses;
pride must give place to humility, resentment to forgiveness, narrow attachment to family to

universal benevolence. This requires selfless practice of love-even of self-sacrifice.

	        page no : 29, 3.1.8 Kindness
</h1>
<p>
	Kindness is a behaviour marked by a pleasant disposition and concern for others. It is recognized  as a value in many cultures and religions. Acts of kindness not only benefit receivers of the kind act, but also the giver, as a result of the release of neurotransmitters responsible for feelings of contentment and relaxation when such acts are committed. Kindness is defined as being “helpful towards someone in need, not in return for anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself, but for that of the person helped”.
</p>
<h1>
	 3.1.9 Courage
</h1>

<p>
	Courage is the quality of mind or spirit that enables a person to face difficulty, danger, pain, etc., without fear. It is the ability and willingness to confront fear, pain, danger, uncertainty, or intimidation. Physical courage is courage in the face of physical pain, hardship, death, or threat of death, while moral courage is the ability to act rightly in the face of popular opposition, shame, scandal, or discouragement. In some traditions, fortitude holds approximately the same meaning as courage.
</p>

<h1>
	 3.1.10 Forgiveness
</h1>
<p>

Forgiveness is the intentional and voluntary process by which a victim undergoes a change in
 feelings and attitude regarding an offence, lets go of negative emotions such as vengefulness, with an increased ability to wish the offender well. In most contexts, forgiveness is granted Without any expectation of restorative justice, and without any response on the part of the offender. Most world religions include teachings on the nature of forgiveness. Some religious doctrines or philosophies place greater emphasis on the need for humans to ﬁnd some sort of divine forgiveness for their own shortcomings, others place greater emphasis on the need for humans to practice forgiveness of one another, yet others make little or no distinction between human and divine forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
	In Vedic literature and epics Hinduism, Kshama describes the concept of forgiveness. The
word kshama is often combined with kripa (tenderness), daya (kindness) and karuna (compassion)
in Sanskrit texts. Forgiveness is considered one of the six cardinal virtues in Hinduism. In Hinduism, not only should one forgive others, but one must also seek forgiveness if one has wronged someone else. Forgiveness is to be sought from the individual wronged, as well as society at large, by acts of charity, purification, fasting, rituals and meditative introspection.

</p>
<h1>
	 3.1.11 Friendship
</h1>

It is said that good people make friends by walking seven steps together. It is easy to make
friends, it is difficult to keep up friendship. One should make friends with both kinds of people, weak and strong. The friendship of the wicked and the good is like the changing Shadow of the ﬁrst and the second halves of a day. A friendship With good, mediocre and bad people is like a line drawn on a

This nectar in the form of two syllables Mitra (friend) provides protection against adversity
and serves as an antidote to allay the heat of affliction caused by grief. Wise people have mentioned the characteristics of a sincere friend. A friend keeps one away from sin, directs one towards good, and keeps secrets. He does not forsake one in adversity and provides timely help.

	3.1.12 Compassion
</h1>
<p>

Compassion is the feeling of empathy for others. Compassion is the emotion that we feel in
response to the suffering of others that motivates a desire to help. The etymology of “compassion” is Latin, meaning “co-suffering.” More involved than simple empathy, compassion commonly gives rise to an active desire to alleviate another’s suffering. In ethical terms, the expressions down the ages of the so-called Golden Rule often embody the principle of compassion: Do to others what you would have them do to you.

</p>
<p>
	Ranked a great virtue in numerous philosophies, compassion is considered in almost all the

major religious traditions as among the greatest of virtues.
</p>
<h1>
	3.1.13 Consideration

<p>

Being considerate is having regard for the needs or feelings of others. It is characterized

by careful thought, showing kindly awareness or regard for another’s feelings and circumstances.

	3.1.14 Contentment
</h1>
<p>

There is no wealth greater than contentment. Those who are greedy of wealth run here and
there in search of it. Those who are satisfied with the nectar of contentment get happiness in What they possess. The best of sages pass their time subsisting on roots and fruits. Contentment is the highest treasure of man.

	3.1.15 Simplicity
</h1>
<p>

Through our life style we can either support or oppose a particular system. By adopting a life
style of simplicity we can reject the existing order of things and support the emergence of a new order. For example, in a world where every day forty thousand children die of starvation, we need to plan our diet more meaningfully. Too much dependence on grain and meat may cause hunger to many and damage the enviromnent as well. We need to save resources. Mahatma Gandhi used to write on the back of calendar

	 pages and used his pencils until the stubs were too small to hold. But many ecologists may waste tons of paper to write something about the protection of environment. Simplicity is a self-imposed rule. It depends upon one’s ability to be free from too much dependence of things. Voluntary simplicity could be the way out of our present culture of consumerism. The non-poor have a responsibility towards the poor and this needs to be reflected in one’s simplicity in life style. If even one person changes his life style it may have far reaching consequences, and may have symbolic value. To bring in significant changes, an action must become a movement. An example can be cited from the freedom struggle in India. Gandhiji led a simple
life and used only locally handmade things. He spun Khadi on a Charkha every day. This became a public movement and led to the mass boycott and burning of British goods as a mark of protest. A lifestyle of simplicity can challenge the the exploitative practices of big industries.

	 3.1.16 Avoiding Greed
</h1>
<p>

The importance of the economic aspect of human life has reached its climax in the contemporary
age of economic culture and commercialized civilization, in which money receives precedence over life and economic interests outweigh ethical duty. But the ancient Indian sages too had included wealth as an important instrumental value for individual and social development. The ditference lies in the fact that whereas the west has considered wealth to be instrumental only for the satisfaction of sensual desires, India has advocated that it is equally essential for the attainment of dharma or morality. According to a Sanskrit saying:Learning gives modesty, modesty leads to worthiness, worthiness brings wealth, wealth leads to morality and morality brings happiness. India had realized long ago, that greediness, economic exploitation and unequal distribution of wealth could lead to social decay and moral degeneration. It has been stated that “A hungry man is prone to commit every kind of sin”.

 man’s greed.”

future. ”  __ Alex Haley

<p>

The importance of the family in the development of personality and the inculcation of values
cannot be overstated. The family provides the fulfilment of the basic needs of the child such as food, clothing and shelter. It also functions as an emotional anchor by offering security and a sense of belonging. Parents are the first teachers and it is through them that the child learns about the home, the neighbourhood and society. The child is particularly influenced by the mother. A mother’s love is unconditional. A mother not only gives the precious gift of life, but nurtures the child with care and supports him at every stage of life. A mother would not think twice before making sacrifices for the sake of the child. She would willingly starve herself to feed the child and willingly foregoes her own comforts in order to provide the best for the child. She is determined to provide opportunities that she herself was denied. Some mothers put in extra hours of work to earn more for the betterment of the child, especially in less well—to—do families in India. It is equally true that, despite the growing awareness of ‘Women’s Liberation’ and ‘Equality of the Genders’ it is common to find highly educated women in well paid jobs in India relegating their career to the background in order to take care of children. The underlying belief is that no-one can take the place of the mother.
</p>
<p>

The father, as the head of the family, plays a crucial role in the development of the child. He
may be the sole or main bread winner in many families and is, often, the one who makes crucial
decisions on matters related to ﬁnance, such as, planning the family budget, buying a house, making investments or even deciding which brand of TV to buy.
</p>
<p>

In a typical family the child grows up in the company of siblings. She learns to play with them
and learn from them. She also quarrels with them occasionally. The child learns qualities of assertiveness, sharing, showing concern for others, engaging in group activities and making little sacrifices from a young age. Thus, the TV remote has to be handed over to an elder brother sometimes, the toy that one has been playing with may have to be given to the younger sister sometimes, the last few chocolates have to be shared equally and so on.
</p>

<p>
	In the ideal family of modern times, both parents enjoy equality of status and treat each other
with respect and affection. All issues are discussed together and decisions, both big and small, are made together. The children, whether boys or girls, are treated equally and no discrimination, whether overt or covert, is shown. Boys in India have traditionally been shown partiality. In many families girls receive fewer educational opportunities, less medical care and even less food when compared to boys. Discrimination is shown in subtle ways even in educated families. Thus, if the maid does not come, it is the girl who is asked to help with the household work, not the boy. Similarly a girl may be dlscouraged from being ambitious about her career plans. Such discrimination should stop and the vicious circle of
perpetuating gender stereotypes in the family should be broken.
</p>

<p>

It is by observing the behaviour of family members that the child imbibes norms of behaviour
as well as ethical values. Parents should, therefore, be role models of good behaviour. They should
</p>

<p>

 remember that the child observes every action they do and every word they speak. Do they (parents)take good care of the grandparents or show impatience and annoyance? When the neighbour’s dog barked  all night, did they come to blows with the neighbour or did they protest in a dignified manner? Did they make the newspaper boy run around five times before paying the bill? Did they lose their temper and grumble endlessly about power outages or did they take it in their stride? Do they participate in community functions and festivals? Do they show concern for the environment by following proper disposal of garbage, not spitting on roads and not wasting water? Did they criticize a relative and talk in a derogatory manner about him? The list is endless. The child learns by imitation how to react and  respond to the social environment. Thus, besides imbibing values like discipline, integrity and hard work from parents, the child also learns about inter-personal relationships, obligations to one’s neighbours, and duties as a member of the community.

3.2.2 Duties of an Individual as a Member of Society
</h1>
<p>

An individual as a member should perform his duty in a spirit of dharma, which is not merely
the performance of one’s religious duty or fulfillment of obligations. It signifies righteous behavior involving the highest sacrifice in following the ideals of truth, integrity and service. Pandit Nehru has described these ideas as follows:

 How amazing is this spirit of man! In spite of innumerable failings, man, throughout the

 ages, has sacrificed his life and all he held dear for an ideal, for truth, for faith, for country and honour. This ideal may change, but that capacity for self-sacrifice continues. In the midst of disaster he has not lost his dignity or his faith in the values he elegized.
</p>
<p>

Tennyson has identified the sovereign spiritual power as self-reverence, self-knowledge,  and self-control and to follow right because right is right. One should regard the whole world as
one’s family. In essence, the duties of an individual in a society are nothing but the performance of dharma which is an attitude of the mind and the cultivation of essential moral qualities of sacrifice, service and dedication.

  3.3 SOCIAL CONCERNS
  3.3.1 Evils of Dowry
</h1>
<p>

Dowry refers to the practice of giving money and gifts by the bride’s father to the groom’s family at the time of marriage. The dowry system is a social evil. It is prevalent 1n all parts of India. In India many of the traditional customs have been given up, but the custom of dowry has not only continued, but flourished over the years. It has become an integral part of the marriage institution.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00034">34</pagenum>
     <h1>
	      page no : 34
</h1>
<p>
	The custom of dowry has become widespread. Even before the marriage, the amount to be given as dowry is discussed and settled. Today it is common for the boy’s parents to openly demand
not only money but other items such as a fancy car, LED T.V. and other household appliances and
articles. Brides bringing less than the expected dowry are often ill-treated by their in-laws and other relatives. Many of them are harassed beyond limits of endurance and commit suicide. Some are brutally burnt alive by the husband and in-laws.
</p>

<p>
	Throughout history voices have been raised against this evil custom. Social reformers like
Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Dayanand tried their best to create a social consciousness against this
practice. Also, the Dowry Prohibition Act was passed in 1961, but it has not made much difference.
</p>
<p>

In ancient times, the parents of the bride gave a token amount to the groom’s family. But the
practice has developed into a full-fledged bargaining today and has become the focal point of the
marriage. Often, all other considerations such as the girl’s family background, qualifications, merits, etc. are set aside. It is high time the present generation opposes this system and stands up for the equality of both sexes to remove the blot of dowry system from the face of society.
</p>
<p>

Girls today are as educated as boys and are in no way inferior to them. They should develop
self-confidence and have the courage to refuse a proposal if dowry is being demanded. Boys should
not yield to parental pressure. They should take a principled stand and insist on a simple marriage. If, after marriage, the bride is subjected to physical or mental harassment for any reason, she should not suffer in silence. She should immediately inform her family members and the matter should be sorted out at the earliest. Domestic violence should not be endured under the mistaken notion that somehow everything will settle down and that it is the duty of the girl to suffer ill-treatment at the hands of the in-laws. Girls should not feel that they are bringing disgrace to the parental family by speaking out against harassment and injustice. They have every right to lead a life of their dreams. Parents should encourage girls to be assertive and they should always be a pillar of support in times of need.
</p>
<p>

The government has enacted many laws to check the dowry system. It is against the law to
either give or take dowry. But, unfortunately, no law can be really effective unless there is widespread enlightment in society. Voluntary organizations should come forward to better the lot of women in India. The removal of dowry system should be at the top on the agenda of social reform both in cities and in villages.
</p>

<h1>
	3.3.2 Gender Discrimination
</h1>
<p>
	The concept of Gender Equality has come into sharp focus in modern times. Article 1 of The
International Human Rights Declaration (1948) states that “ All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.”The Indian Constitution too envisages the ideals of equality, liberty and justice for all and emphasizes equality of status and opportunity irrespective of gender.
</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00035">35</pagenum>

    <h1>
	     page no : 35
</h1>
<p>
	During the 19th century women in western countries fought for the right to vote. In the USA, it was only after the abolition of slavery in 1865 and after prolonged agitations by women that the Right of Universal Suffrage was granted in 1920. In India both men and women were granted equal rights to vote and stand for elections from the time the Indian Constitution came into force in 1950. Today women also  enjoy some property rights and, according to certain recent amendments, one third of seats in various political institutions are reserved for them. Laws are also being amended to provide greater safety and  protection to women, both in public as well as at their work place. Stringent laws such as Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code have been framed to prevent domestic violence against women and to curb the menace of dowry. The Nirbhaya Act, passed in 2013 , provides death penalty for offences against women, such as rape and also takes serious note of offences like acid throwing and stalking.
</p>
<p>

However, laws serve only a limited purpose. Women face an unequal battle in India even
before they are born! Even in this day and age there are several families who rejoice over the birth of a son and mourn the birth of a daughter. They believe that it is the son who will carry on the family lineage and it is he who will look after parents in their old age and, finally, according to tradition, perform the last rites after their death. Whereas, the birth of a girl, they believe, would entail huge expenses in the form of dowry and marriage arrangements. Because of these ingrained beliefs they have no scruples in
opting for sex-determination tests and, if they ﬁnd that the foetus is a female, they go in for abortion rather than bring a girl into the world. In some states like Haryana the practice of female foeticide is so rampant that the male: female ratio has become skewed.
</p>

<p>
	The 2011 census revealed the shocking fact that the national male: female ratio is 1000:940. Haryana has the lowest ratio of 1000:879. These grim figures indicate the chilling truth about the odds that are stacked against the girl child in India. It is only in Kerala and Puducherry that females outnumber males.
</p>

<p>
Even if the female foetus survives till birth, there is no guarantee that the baby girl will continue to live. Female infanticide is prevalent in India and it is common to hear about baby girls being abandoned and left to die, or even being killed by being subjected to slow starvation or asphyxiation (being smothered to death). In certain districts of Tamil Nadu the practice was so widespread that the government announced the “Cradle Baby Scheme”(1992) whereby unwanted babies could be left anonymously in the care of government agencies. Special financial incentives for the girl child, including assistance during the girl’s marriage were announced.

</p>
<p>
It is at the family level itself that gender discrimination should stop. Boys and girls should be
 treated equally from birth. Girls should not be considered a burden. Given equal opportunities, girls are outshining boys in several ﬁelds. Often it is they and not the sons who look after the parents in their old age. It is the duty of parents to provide equal educational facilities to sons and daughters and encourage both to pursue careers of their choice.

<p>
	Gender stereotypes should not be reinforced, even indirectly. We unthinkingly give toy guns
as presents to boys and dolls to girls. The subtle message is that violence can be condoned in boys while girls are expected to be meek and passive ‘housekeepers’. Boys too should share household chores like Washing clothes and sweeping the house and girls encouraged to participate in activities generally deemed masculine. The concept of gender equality, therefore, needs to be inculcated from childhood, both in boys as well as girls.
</p>
<h1>
3.3.3 Caste System
</h1>
<p>
	Man is a social being and, over the ages devised various methods of social organization. Thus,
in Europe the ‘class’ system evolved while in India we have the ‘Caste’ system.
</p>

<p>
	The word ‘caste’ is derived from Portuguese Casta, i.e race or brood. The Sanskrit equivalent
is Jati which refers to blood or birth of a person. Caste at present means more than mere birth. It has grown into a socio-religious system and determines relations between all Hindus. Talking ethnologically caste is "an endogamous group or collection of groups bearing a common name and generally having the same traditional occupation, linked by the tradition of a common origin, of having the same tutelary deity, of Claiming the same social status, of following the same ceremonial Observances prescribed by family priests, so that members regard themselves as forming a single homogenous community.” Each caste lays its own rules of life, in conformity with the basic principles of Hinduism.
</p>

<p>
	There are about 3000 castes and sub-castes in India. No social or religious or economic or
even political group seems to escape the inexorable laws of caste. But, in the ancient past, there only were four main varnas—Brahmins i.e. Priests; Kshatriyas, i.e. Warriors; Vyshyas i.e. Businessmen; and, Sudras, i.e. Manual workers. In the Gita, Lord Krishna says, ‘the four castes are created by me by the differentiation of Guna (temperament) and Karma (work)’. The Sanskrit word for these four original castes is Varna which means colour. It is believed that the first three castes belonged to the Aryan race. It is probable that the caste system in India had its origins in racial differences.

</p>
<p>
	In ancient times caste merely denoted the profession that one was born into. But in due course
of time it deteriorated and proliferated into the present system with its social stratification based on endogamy and no commonality.

</p>
<p>
	Over and above the four orthodox castes Hinduism soon had another caste, called the  Panchama or fifth caste. Outside India it is known as the Pariah Caste. Members of this caste are also known as Antyaja or excluded ones. The pariahs have also been divided into sub-castes. Though untouchability and discrimination based on caste are prohibited by law in modern India, they are, none-the-less, still rampant, particularly in villages. A concerted attempt is being made to bring the so-called ‘untouchable’ and down-trodden people into the mainstream by providing special economic and educational concessions and facilities.

	3.3.4 Need to Recognize Dignity of Labour,page no : 37
</h1>

<p>
	“ All labour that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken
with painstaking excellence” —— Martin Luther King Jr
</p>

<p>
 In many societies it is the norm to look down on blue collared workers who do menial jobs and
respect those with white collared or executive jobs. This discrimination, however, is ethically wrong. All men are equal in the eyes of God. It is not really what job one does but how one does it that is important. while society needs doctors, lawyers and policemen, it is equally true that life would be well nigh impossible without the services of people like construction workers, plumbers, bus drivers and gardeners. Besides, people of the humblest origins have reached the highest positions through sheer grit and perseverance. Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the USA was born in a one room log cabin. Closer home, we have the example of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was a vendor of tea in his youth.
</p>

<p>
	Mahatma Gandhi strove ceaselessly to emphasize the concept of dignity of labour. He said
"obedience to the law of bread labour will bring about a silent revolution in the structure of society.” The degrading practice of scavengers being made to manually cany night soil was abandoned largely through his efforts. Though the caste system has been abolished it has not been possible to eradicate social prejudice against some of the so-called lower castes who are traditionally engaged 1n menial work. Universal education alone is the panacea for such social evils.
</p>

<h1>
	3.3.5 Social Discrimination based on Race/Colour
</h1>

<p>
	Gandhiji’s zeal for social reform may have had its origins in his own experiences of social
discrimination in South Africa. Once when he was travelling in that country (in 1863) by train in ﬁrst class, an Englishman objected, and asked him to get down. Gandhiji refused to do so, and the Englishman got Gandhiji thrown out at Maritzburg in the middle of the night. This deeply hurt the self-respect of gandhiji and he decided to launch a campaign for the equality of all human beings and to end social discrimination. Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968) fought for the rights of Negroes in America and for the annulment of laws which discriminated against Negroes. As late as in the 1950s racial prejudice and segregation was rampant in the U.S.A. Rosa Parks, a Black woman, refused to give up her seat in a bus to a white man in 1955 and this act sparked a movement throughout the country against racial discrimination.

	In India racially motivated crimes have been committed against people from the north-eastern
states simply because the people of those states look different from other Indians.

<p>
	Gandhiji and Martin Luther King Jr. are well known figures who fought against social

discrimination and their mission in life was to ensure equality and dignity to all sections of people. The sun, the moon, the river and the wind, do not make any discrimination between the rich and the poor, high and the low. They make themselves available to everyone. All are equal in the eyes of God. Then, what is the justification for artificial and man-made divisions of caste, creed and gender?

The  National Cadet Corps (NCC) came into existence on 16 July 1948 under an Act of Parliament. Its motto ‘Unity and Discipline’ has guided the NCC in its long-standing effort to mould young volunteers into disciplined and responsible citizens of India. Over the years, in response to the evolving environment, the NCC’s initial military orientation was augmented by dimensions of social service and adventure training.

<p>
  The NCC is a responsive, learning and continuously evovling organization. Its activity is guided by certain core values that we endeavour to instill among all ranks of the NCC. These include the following:
a)  A sense of patriotic commitment to encourage cadets to contribute to national development

b) Respect for diversities in religion, language, culture, ethnicity, life style and habitat and to instill a sense of National unity and social cohesion

c) Abiding commitment to learn and adhere to the norms and values enshrined in the Indian
Constitution

d) Understanding the value of a just and impartial exercise of authority

e) Ability to participate in community development and other social programmes
f) A healthy life style free of substance abuse and other unhealthy practices
g) Sensitivity to the needs of poor and socially disadvantaged fellow citizens

	3.4.2 National Service Scheme (NSS)
</h1>

<p>
	In India, the idea of involving students 1n the task of national service dates back to the times of Mahatma Gandhi, the father of the nation. Advising Students to form a living contact with the community in whose midst their institution is located, he suggested that instead of undertaking academic research about economic and social disability, they should do “something positive so that the life of the villagers might be raised to a higher material and moral level ”.

</p>


<p>
	 On September 24, 1969, the then Union Education Minister Dr.V.K.R.V.Rao launched the
NSS programme in 37 universities covering all States . It was appropriate that the programme was
started during the Gandhi Centenary year as it was Gandhiji who inspired the Indian youth to participate in the movement for Indian independence and for the social uplift of the downtrodden masses of our nation.
</p>
  <p>
 The cardinal principle of the programme is that it is organised by the students themselves and
both students and teachers, through their combined participation in social service, get a sense of
involvement in the tasks of national development. Besides, the students obtain work experience which might help them to find avenues of self-employment or employment in any organisation at the end of their university career.

</p>
<h1>
3.4.2.1 The main objectives of National Service Scheme (NSS) are that the students should:

<p>
i. understand the community in which they work

ii. understand themselves in relation to their community

iii. identify the needs and problems of the community and involve them in problem-solving

iv. develop among themselves a sense of social and civic responsibility

vi. develop competence required for group-living and sharing of responsibilities

vii. gain skills in mobilising community participation

viii. acquire leadership qualities and democratic attitudes

3.4.2.2 Adoption of Villages,page no : 40

</h1>

<p>
	 Adoption of a village and area is a very meaningful programme in NSS. It is far better to
concentrate on one village and take up the task of development there, than to fritter away energy in many locations involving too many activities which may not be completed at all or where follow up action may not be possible. From this point of view, the village adoption programme should ensure continuity of work along with sustained action, evaluation and follow up work.

</p>
<h1>
	3.4.2.3 Adoption of Slums
</h1>

<p>
	Most of the colleges and universities are located in urban areas. Due to the long distance
between the college campuses and the villages, the visits to the adopted villages by the NSS volunteers may become expensive and time consuming. In view of this it is desirable to adopt slums, espec1ally by colleges located in urban areas.

</p>
<h1>
	3.4.2.4 Coordination with Voluntary Organizations
</h1>

<p>
	It may be noted that the NSS unit has no financial resource to implement any programme in
the adopted villages or slum on its own. Therefore, a successful unit has to closely coordinate with government agencies and voluntary organisations working in this field.
</p>

<p>
	The NSS Programme Officers should plan activities in the adopted village or slum in such a

 way that the leisure time of the NSS volunteers can be utilized in the service of adopted village or slum. Week-end visits to the adopted areas provide suitable opportunities to interact with the members of the community and know their problems and make an earnest effort to do something for them. Similarly  efforts should be made to follow up the Work done in the areas earlier. Such sustained efforts will flower into friendship between the NSS unit and the community. These activities can be arranged through one day camps and frequent visits under regular activities.

</h1>

<p>
	NGC was initiated in 2001 and achieved significant success through Eco Clubs established in

schools. The Ministry of Environment & Forests (MoEF) had initially aimed at 50,000 Eco clubs in the nationwide programme. The phenomenal response that NGC has received has made the network

cross more than 1,00,000 Eco clubs across the country in 10 years, making it one of the largest

conservation networks. The unique partnership between the MoEF, the states, Government agencies
along with the dedicated NGOs, working in the field of Environmental Education has contributed to the success of the programme. It is a well-established and recognised fact that children can be catalysts in promoting a mass movement about various environmental issues. As they are the future citizens, inculcation of environment friendly attitudes and behavioural patterns amongst them can make a significant difference to the long term efforts for protection of environment. Children are triggers for a chain reaction, making a difference at the local and community level which in due course lead to awareness at the village, city, state, country and global level.

	4.1  THE NEED FOR LIFE SKILLS DURING TEENAGE
</h1>
<p>

Teenage is a predominant and significant stage of growth and development of human life. It is
the transition period from childhood to adulthood. During teenage, rapid changes take place in the mind body. Physical and psychological changes occur. Teenagers feel curious and embarrassed about the physical changes in their bodies. Mood swings are common. Hormonal changes take place. The rapid changes in the body and the mind may leave teens confused and frightened. They find
themselves being drawn to members of the opposite sex and may feel self conscious, excited and nervous. They are  often unable to adjust smoothly to the transition between childhood and
adulthood.
</p>

<p>
	During this turbulent period they rebel against their parents and elders and seek the approval and companionship of their peers.
</p>

<p>
	     Adolescence is a crucial and dangerous period because it is fraught with experimentation
and risk-taking. It is a time of emotional upheaval.
</p>
<p>

 Teenagers strive to assert their independence. They ignore the advice of their parents as they
feel they are now old enough to make their own decisions. They turn increasingly to their peer group for support. In their misguided zeal to establish their individuality they may make hasty and unwise choices and pay a heavy price for being defiant and reckless. For instance thay may experiment with activities that are disapproved by elders and which are pOtentially dangerous, such as smoking cigarettes, taking drugs and casual sex.
</p>

<p>
	The family structure in India has undergone radical changes in the last few decades. The joint
family system is breaking up and nuclear families are the norm today. It is common to ﬁnd both parents going out to work and returning home late in the evening. In such a scenario the teen may have unbridled freedom and lacks a restraining influence. The emotional security found in a joint family is missing Parents, because of their own hectic life style, may not be able to provide proper guidance and counselling despite wanting to do so. In these circumstances, therefore, it is essential for teenagers to develop special abilities that can help them to cope with the stresses, challenges and problems of life. The psycho-social skills which enble one to respond to situations in a confident and intelligent manner are called life skills.
</p>
<h1>
	4.2 LIFE SKILLS PERSPECTIVE
</h1>

<p>
	The term ‘life skills’ refers to the skills usually associated with managing and leading a better
quality of life. They help us to accomplish our abilities and realize our full potential.
</p>
<p>

There is no definitive list of life skills. Certain skills may be more or less relevant to you
depending upon your life circumstances, your culture, beliefs, age, geographical location etc.
</p>
<p>

Life skills are defined by the UNICEF as ‘psychological abilities for adaptive and positive
behaviour that enable individuals to deal effectively with the demands and challenges of everyday life.
They are loosely grouped into three broad categories of skills-cognitive skills for analyzing and using

information, personal skills for developing personal agency and managing oneself and inter-personal skills for communicating and interacting effectively with others.’
</p>
<p>

Life skills are behaviours used appropriately and responsibly for
the management of personal affairs. They are a set of human skills acquired
via teaching or direct experience that are used to handle problems and
questions commonly encountered in daily human life.
</p>

<h1>
	4.2.1 Goal Setting, page no : 45
</h1>

<p>
	Many people work hard but they don’t get anywhere worthwhile. The key reason might be
they haven’t spent enough time to identify their wants and haven’t set their formal goals.

</p>
<p>
	Goal setting helps us to choose/identify our wants and to concentrate our efforts to achieve
our goals by avoiding distractions.
</p>

<p>
	Goal setting is a powerful process for planning one’s ideal future and for motivating
oneself to turn one’s vision of the future into reality.
</p>

<p>
	Effective goal setting is essential to achieve our goals in a successful, focused and decisive

manner by taking right actions in less time. Many people abandon their goals midway due to lack of

confidence, not having a practicable plan, being unrealistic by expecting too much too soon, fear of

failure and putting too much pressure on themselves. Plan, organize and prioritize your goals in small,
meaningful chunks. Some goals, such as health goals, need to be ongoing ones, So establish a daily

routine. For example under the goal of maintaining good health you can jot down: exercise 3-4 times a  week, eat a balanced and nutritious diet and get 7-8 hours of sleep.

</p>
<p>
	Review, update and revise your goals regularly to ensure they are still relevant to you. Doing

so also keeps you on track and helps you to take appropriate steps and actions. Staying focused and

intensely motivated is one of the hardest things to do when setting goals. It is common to periodically fall

off the wagon. However it is essential to get back on track as soon as possible.

</p>
<p>
	A great tool for keeping you focused is to maintain a journal or work book. Go over it

 regularly as a reference and to remind yourself about what you want to accomplish. Set up routines or
habits that will ensure you stay on track. For example; do your exercises at the same time each day,
drink your protein shake first thing in the morning.
</p>

<p>
	Other helpful techniques for staying motivated include the use of relevant affirmations and

 visualization. Affirmations are reminders of the beliefs, values or goals that one wishes to follow or
accomplish. A student who keeps telling himself over and over again that he can get good marks in a
subject is more likely to succeed than another who feels that it is a hopeless task and slips into despair.
Visualization involves making mental pictures associated with the goals one wishes to achieve. Thus, a
student can create in his mind the image of getting good marks and being praised by the teacher or
 being hugged by his parents. This picture acts as a re-inforcement to study.
</p>

<p>
	Many successful people, especially athletes, swear by both these techniques. It is important

 to see yourself accomplishing a goal before you actually do so. Positive affirmation implants positive

thoughts into your subconscious mind, which in turn prompt you to take right actions to achieve your
goals.

	 4.2.2 Self—Esteem and Self—Confidence
</h1>
<p>

Self—esteem is a term used in psychology to reflect a person’s overall emotional evaluation of
his own worth. It is a judgement of oneself as well as an attitude toward the self. It encompasses beliefs
(e.g. I’m worthy, I’m competent) and emotions such as triumph, despair, pride and shame.
</p>
<p>

Experiences in a person’s life are a major
source of developing self-esteem. The positive or
negative life experiences one undergoes create attitudes
towards the self, which can be favourable and help to
develop positive feelings of self—worth, or can be
unfavourable and contribute to negative feelings of self
—worth. In the early stage of human life parents are the
most significant influence on self — esteem and the main
sources of positive or negative experiences a child has.

</p>
 <p>

Adolescents crave for high self— esteem. They make appraisals of themselves based on their
closeness with their friends. Social acceptance also leads to high self— esteem.

been called a hallmark of adolescent experience. Peer conformity in young people is most pronounced
with respect to style, taste, appearance, ideology and values. Peer pressure is commonly associated
with episodes of adolescent risk taking (such as delinquency, drugs abuse, sexual behaviour etc.) because
these activities commonly occur in the company of peers.
</p>

<p>
	Affiliation with friends who engage in risk behaviour has been shown to be a strong predictor
of an adolescent’s own behaviour. Peer pressure can also have positive effects when youth are pressured
by their peers towards positive behaviour such as volunteering for charity, or excelling in academics.
The importance of peers declines upon entering adulthood.
</p>
<h1>
	4.5.1 Dealing with Peer Pressure
</h1>

<p>
	. Saying ‘no’ to peer pressure is tough, but you can do it. Paying attention to your own
feelings and beliefs, and having conviction about what is right and what is wrong can help
you take the right stand.

. Inner strength and self-confidence can help you stand firm, walk away and resist doing
something which you know is wrong or inadvisable even though “everyone else is doing it .”

. Choose your friends wisely as, together as a group, you can resist being pressurized towards
substance abuse or other undesirable activities.

. Try to help friends who are finding it difficult to resist peer pressure.

. If you continue to face peer pressure and you are finding it difficult to handle it, talk to
someone you trust. Don’t feel guilty if you have made a mistake. Talking to a parent,
teacher or a counsellor can help you feel much better and prepare you for the next time
you face peer pressure.

. Peer pressure is not always a bad thing. Peers having good values can exert pressure on
each other to do what is right.

<h1>
	5.1 INTRODUCTION
</h1>
<p>

An Environmentalist is concerned with the protection of the natural world of land, sea, air,
trees and animals. As the population increases, the need or demand for natural resources also increases.
Ultimately, this results in a lot of pressure on the natural resources. Depletion and degradation of natural
 resources is taking place inexorably. Pollution of air, water and soil is further damaging the natural
environment and causing immeasurable harm.
</p>
<h1>
	5.2 RESPECT FOR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Panchabhutas

</h1>
 <p>
	Indian culture and tradition has always stressed the need to protect the environment. NO
Other culture and tradition perhaps lays as much emphasis on environmental ethics. According to the
tenets of ancient Indian Philosophy the universe is made up of panchabhutas or five elements. These
elements include Bhumi (earth), Jala (water), Agni (Fire), Vayu (Air) and Akasha (Ether/ Space). It is
believed that the body of all animals and humans is composed of these elements. Similarly, all foods are
derived from these elements. It is believed that these elements should remain in balance. Any deviation
from the balance Of elements will result in natural disasters and, ill health in the case of humans.
</p>

<p>
	It is not surprising, therefore, that the elements were held in reverence in Vedic times. Yagnas,
for example were conducted regularly to invoke the blessings Of the gods. Modern man, in his arrogance,
thinks that he has conquered Nature by sending space ships to distant planets, by exploring the depths

<p>

of oceans and by climbing the highest mountains. But tsunamis, earthquakes, hurricanes, forest ﬁres and
avalanches are grim reminders that man has to bow before Nature.

The great epics and literary texts such as the Ramayana, Mahabharatha, Vedas, Upanishads
and Smrithis contain the earliest messages for the preservation of environment and ecological balance.
The Bhagavad Gita advises us not to tamper with the environment, or wrestle with it. If it seems
hostile at times, tolerate it. Ecology is an inherent part of a spiritual world view of Indian culture and
tradition. Thus we are exhorted to worship all living and non-living organisms (natural resources and
animals) as the embodiment of God. Though the concept may seem like a silly superstition, there is a
scientific basis for such a belief. It is only by developing respect for our environment that we can hope
to maintain ecological balance and bio-diversity.
</p>

<h1>
	5.2.1 Land
</h1>
<p>

Land and land resources refer to the delineable area of the earth’s terrestrial surface
encompassing all attributes of the bio-sphere immediately above and below this surface, including those
of the near surface, climate, the soil and terrain forms, the surface hydrology (including shallow lakes,
rivers, marshes and swamps), the plant and animal population, the human settlement pattern and physical
results of past and present human activity (terracing, water storage or drainage structures, roads and
buildings etc.)—(FAO/UNEP 1997)
</p>

<p>
	Land sometimes is defined as the original and indestructible power of the soil. Land is a fixed
and tangible asset. Land comprises all natural resources whose supply is inherently fixed. Examples are
geographical locations, mineral deposits and even geostationary orbit locations.
</p>
<p>

In Indian tradition land is personified as the mother goddess and called “Bhoomatha”. This
implies that we must take care of our land as we take care of our mother. Only if we actively protect the
environment, will the environment co-operate with us.
</p>
<h1>
	5.2.2 Trees
</h1>
<p>

Trees and animals form an integral part of the environment. Protection of these two major
resources is vital for maintaining eco-balance.

Trees hold the soil in place to reduce erosion and improve water quality. Trees provide us
food, materials for shelter and fuel. They replenish the air we breathe. Trees provide food for animals
and are the habitat of wild life.
</p>

<p>
	Trees also help to cool the earth. Trees release moisture during transpiration. More moisture
in the air results in more rain. As all living things need water, trees play an important role in the very
survival of all species of animal and plant life. Trees cool the environment through water evaporation
and by providing shade. They act like huge pumps to cycle water up from the soil back into the air.

<p>
	earth need air to live. Air is, thus, a life sustaining factor. Air is also essential for fuel to burn  and for
many chemical reactions. Any kind of fire or combustion consumes a certain amount of oxygen in the
air. We also use air to inflate pneumatic tyres. We use air in hot balloons. We use air bubbles to make
mattresses light and fluffy.
</p>
<p>

Air is an inexhaustible natural resource which is essential for our survival. Air contains a
mixture of gases such as Nitrogen (78%) Oxygen (21%), Carbon dioxide, Ammonia, Ozone and
Noble gases (Helium, Neon etc).
</p>

<p>
	In Indian tradition we worship air as Vayudeva.

<h1>
	5.3 UNETHICAL PRACTICES LEADING TO DEGRADATION OF NATURAL
RESOURCES

</h1>
<p>
	 Unethical practices take place when people do things that are not necessarily illegal, but
immoral. These things can be hiding information, not telling the Whole truth about something or doing
something wrong and then covering it up. Unethical as well as illegal actions of man have, over the past
few decades, led to the degradation of the natural environment and depletion of resources.
</p>

<h1>
	5.3.1 Depletion of Natural Resources
</h1>
<p>

Depletion is the use of or consumption of a natural resource faster than it is replenished.
Depletion is a drain on resources.
</p>

<p>
	Human beings are exploiting natural resources ruthlessly for their own benefit. They are not
bothered about the effects of the depletion of natural resources on future generations.
</p>

<h1>
	5.3.2 Soil Erosion
</h1>
<p>

Erosion is the process by which soil and rocks are removed from the earth’s surface by
exogamic processes such as wind or water flow and then transported and deposited in other locations.
</p>
<p>

While erosion is a natural process, human activities have increased the rate of erosion by 10-
40 times. Excessive erosion causes problems such as desertification, decrease in agricultural productivity
due to land degradation, sedimentation of waterways and ecological collapse due to loss of nutrient rich
upper soil layers. Water and wind erosion are now the two primary causes of land degradation.
Together they are responsible for 84% degradation, making excessive erosion one of the most significant
global environmental problems.
</p>








<pagenum page="normal" id="page00060">60</pagenum>

<h1>
	 page no : 60
</h1>

<p>
	Erosion of soil occurs due to rainfall, rivers and streams, coastal erosion, glaciers, floods,
freezing wind erosion and lighting strikes.
</p>

<h1>
	5.3.2.1 Conservative Measures to Prevent Soil Erosion
</h1>
<p>

 Plants provide protective cover on the land and prevent soil erosion for the following reasons -
 a. Plants slow down the rain water as it ﬂows over the land (run Off) and this allows much of the
 rain to soak into the ground.

b. Plant roots hold the soil in position and prevent it from being washed away.

c. Plants break the impact of the rain before it hits the soil, thus reducing its ability to erode the soil.

d. Plants in Wetlands and on the banks of the rivers are of particular importance as they slow
doWn the ﬂow of the water and their roots bind the soil, thus preventing erosion.
</p>
<p>

Prevention of soil erosion requires adoption of technological measures which includes -
1. Use of contour ploughing and windbreaks.
2. Weaving unploughed grass strips between ploughed lands.
3. Making sure that there are always plants growing on the soil and that the soil is rich in humus
 (decaying plant and animal remains). This organic matter is the 'glue’ that ‘binds’ the soil
particles together and plays an important part in preventing erosion.
4. Avoiding overgrazing and over use of crop lands.
5. Allowing indigenous plants to thrive along the river banks instead of ploughing and planting
crops right up to the water’s edge.
6. Encouraging biological diversity by planting several different types of plants together.
7. Conservation of wet lands.
8. Intensive cropping and use of proper drainage canals.
9. Terracing the sloping fields as this retards the speed of the flowing water.
10.Planting trees and sowing different kinds of grasses.
11.Carrying out extensive afforestation practices.
</p>

<h1>
	5.3.3 Deforestation
</h1>

<p>
	Deforestation occurs when humans clear or remove large areas of forest lands and related
eco  systems for non-forest use. These include clearing for farming purposes, ranching and urban use.
In most cases trees are never re-planted.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00061">61</pagenum>
      <h1>
	      page no : 61
</h1>

<p>
	Since the Industrial age, about half of world’s original forests have been destroyed and millions
of animals and plant species have been endangered. Despite improvements in education, information
and general awareness of the importance of the forests, deforestation has not reduced much and there
are still many communities and individuals who ruthlessly destroy forest lands for personal gains.
</p>
<p>

 Deforestation occurs for many reasons. Trees are cut down to be used or sold as fuel or
timber, While cleared land is used as pasture for livestock ,plantations of commodities and settlements.
The removal of trees without sufficient reforestation has resulted in damage to habitat, biodiversity loss
and aridity.
</p>
<p>

Deforestation has also been used in war to deprive the enemy of cover for its forces and also
vital resources. For instance,Agent Orange, a defoliant was used by the Americans during the vietnam
  war in the 1960s.
</p>
<p>

Disregard or ignorance of intrinsic values, lack of forest management and deficient environment
laws are some of the factors that allow deforestation to occur on a large scale.
</p>

<h1>
	5.3.3.1 Control of Deforestation
</h1>
<p>
	 Deforestation should be curbed by taking proper steps.
1.If at all deforestation is inevitable, elsewhere reforestation should be taken up.
2.If one tree is cut two should be planted.
3.New methods of cultivation towards high-yields in small areas should be developed.
4. Good forest management techniques should be incorporated.
5. Rewards should be announced to those who take measures to conserve trees.
6. Forests should be kept under the care of strict and non-corrupt officers.
</p>

<h1>
	5.3.4 Mining
</h1>

<p>
	Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth.
</p>
<p>

Ores recovered by mining includes metals, coal and oil, shale, gemstones, limestone, rock salt
and potash, gravel and clay. Mining is required to obtain any material that cannot be grown through
agricultural processes or created artificially in a laboratory or factory. Mining in a wider sense includes
extraction of any non-reversible resource such as petroleum, natural gas or even water.
</p>
<p>

Mining of stone and metal has been carried out since pre-historic times. Modern mining processes
involve prospecting for ore bodies, analysis of profit potential of a proposed mine, extraction of the
desired materials and final reclamation of the land after the mine is closed.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00062">62</pagenum>
<h1>
	 page no : 62
</h1>

 <p>
	The nature of mining process creates a potential negative impact on the environment both
during the mining operations and for years after the mine is closed. This impact has led most of the
world’s nations to adopt regulations designed to moderate the negative effects of mining operations.
safety has long been a concern as well, and modern practices have improved safety in mines signiﬁcantly.
</p>
<p>

The environmental impact of mining include erosion, loss of bio diversity and contamination of
soil, ground water and surface water by chemicals from mining processes. In some cases additional
forest logging is done in the vicinity of the quarries. Besides environmental damage, the contamination
resulting from leakage of chemicals also affects the health of the local population.
</p>

<h1>
	5.3.4.1 Preventive Measures for Illegal Mining
</h1>

<p>
	Illegal mining should be punished severely. Vigilance zones should be set up in the surroundings
of mines.

</p>
<h1>
	5.3.5 Pollution
</h1>
<p>
	 Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse
change.Pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat or light.
pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances, energies or naturally occurring
contaminants. Pollution takes place in various forms such as Air Pollution, Water pollution, Sound
pollution, Soil pollution etc.,
</p>

<h1>
	Air Pollution
</h1>
<p>
	The contamination of air by pollutants is a major concern today as it adversely affects the
quality of life of not only human beings but of animals and plants too. The main source of air pollution is
the chemicals that are released in the air by large industries while burning fossil fuels for the production
of energy. The emission of particulate matter by vehicles is another source of air pollution, particularly
in advanced countries, where it is common for each family to have several cars, including SUVs which
consume a lot of fuel. In India the use of fuelwood, biomass cakes(gobar) and trash as cooking fuel in
open stoves or chullas is a major cause of air pollution. Chemical compounds like oxides of nitrogen
and sulphur are released into the air where they remain suspended for a long time.
</p>
<p>

 Smog and acid rain are manifestations of severe air pollution. The inhalation of polluted air
causes various respiratory problems and also contributes to diseases like lung cancer. Stringent checks
on industries, encouragement of hybrid vehicles Which run on electricity instead of on fossil fuels like
diesel and petrol, use of clean Cooking fuels and a ban on the burning of garbage can bring down levels
of air pollution.

</p>
<p>
	CFCs or chlorinated Fluorocarbons are organic compounds which were commonly used
earlier in refrigeration, air conditioning and cleaning products between the 1920s and the 1980s. While

</p>









<pagenum page="normal" id="page00063">63</pagenum>

<h1>
	 page no : 63
</h1>

 <p>
	the CFCs by themselves are not hazardous to health, studies have shown that the indiscriminate use of
CFCs has caused great damage to the environment. It has resulted in global warming or increase in the
temperature of the earth’s climate, which in turn has serious long term implications for human health and
living conditions. Further, the use of CFCs has led to the depletion of the Ozone layer in the stratosphere.
The Ozone layer offers a protective shield to living organisms on earth as it blocks the harmful effects of
the ultra violet rays of the sun. Stringent measures taken from the 1990s have resulted in the disuse of
CFCs and today more eco friendly methods of refrigeration are being used.
</p>

<h1>
	Water Pollution
</h1>
<p>

The main cause of the contamination of water is the release of effluents by industries into
rivers, lakes and sewers. Laws against such practices are largely ignored in India and flouted with
impunity. The discharge of effluents in rivers by tanneries and textile mills has polluted the Ganges
irredeemably. The sheer volumes of the untreated toxic and non biodegradable waste that are being
dumped into rivers daily have made it a Herculean task to clean them. The Ganga Action Plan, initiated
in 1986 to reduce pollution in the holy river was abandoned in 2000 after a mind boggling amount of
over 20,000 crore rupees was spent, as it proved ineffective. The Clean Ganga Project is one of the
election promises made by the Modi government. Citizens can do their bit for cleaner water bodies by
not bathing, defecating or washing clothes in them, not dumping garbage and refraining from immersing
idols which are not biodegradable during festivals. Drinking of water which is contaminated with various
chemicals and residues of pesticides and fertilizers can cause irreparable damage to health, including
stomach and liver problems, besides neurological problems.
</p>

<h1>
	Noise Pollution
</h1>
<p>

Excessive noise in the environment is not just an irritant but can cause immense neurological

damage to humans as well as animals. The chief sources of noise pollution are heavy machinery,

Vehicles plying on roads as well as aeroplanes and burning of crackers. Hearing loss, increase in blood
pressure, migraine attacks and neurological damage are some of the effects of noise pollution. Sound
proofing techniques should be incorporated by industries. Horns should be plied sparingly and the sale
of loud crackers should be discouraged.
</p>

<h1>
	5.3.5.1 Preventive Measures for Pollution
</h1>
<p>
	a. Keep your surroundings clean; waste should be placed in bins.
b. Exhausts from automobiles and workshop machinery should be controlled.
c. Public transport should be used instead of private transport.
d. Wastage of water should be avoided by repairing and replacement of taps/knobs.
e. Industrial waste containing various harmful chemicals should be pre-treated (to remove toxicants)
and sent to the drainage system.
</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page00064">64</pagenum>
<h1>
	 page no : 64
</h1>

<p>
	f. Use of bio-fertilizers can reduce soil pollution.

g. Plastic usage can be reduced to avoid soil pollution.

h.Control of land loss and Soil erosion can be attempted through restoring forest and grass cover.

i. Crop rotation or mixed cropping can improve the fertility of the land.

j. Sound pollution can be restricted by implementing strict rules like banning the use of loud
speakers or public address system at night.
</p>
<p>

Pollution and degradation of natural resources should be avoided. Industrial waste should be
disposed of in a manner that does not harm the environment. Today vast areas of forest land and water
bodies have disappeared because of the unethical practices of industries. Industrial pollution has changed
the colour of the Taj Mahal from a pristine white to a dull yellow.

<h1>
	5.4 USE OF PLASTICS AND PESTICIDES
</h1>
<p>

‘Plastics’ is a general common term used for a wide range of synthetic or semi synthetic organic
Solid materials suitable for the manufacture of industrial products. Plastics are typically polymers of high
molecular weight and may contain other substances to improve performance and/or reduce costs.
</p>

<p>
	Plastics are one of the few new chemical materials which pose environmental problems.
Polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene are largely used in the manufacture of plastics.
</p>

<p>
	Plastics pollute beaches and oceans. They become litter. Plastic bags find their way into
waterways, parks, beaches and Streets. If they are burnt they infuse the air with toxic gases.
</p>

<p>
	Many animals ingest plastic bags, mistaking them for food, and therefore die. Worse, the
ingested plastic bag remains intact even after the death and decomposition of the animal. There is
every chance that another animal may ingest it. Plastic is non-bio degradable and thus it remains in the
 environment for decades together without decomposing.
</p>

<p>
	Plastics cause different diseases like cancer. Recycling of plastic is also associated with skin
and respiratory problems.
</p>

<h1>
	5.4.1 Measures to Minimize Usage of Plastics
</h1>

. using writing paper or making note pads out of paper used on only one side.

. finding ways to re-use things like glass jars and plastic tubs, and distributing them.
</p>

<h1>
	5.4.2 Pesticides
</h1>

<p>
	A pesticide is any substance used to kill, repel or control certain forms of plant or animal life
 that are considered to be pests.
</p>
<p>
	Pesticides include herbicides for destroying weeds and other unwanted vegetation, insecticides
for controlling a wide variety of insects, fungicides for preventing the growth of molds and mildews,
disinfectants for preventing the spread of bacteria and compounds used to control mice and rats.
</p>
<p>

 Because of the widespread use of agricultural chemicals in food production, people are exposed
to low levels of pesticide residues through their diets. Scientists do not have as yet a clear understanding
of the health effects of these pesticide residues.
</p>
<p>

Studies have shown that farmers who used agricultural insecticides experienced an increase in
headaches, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness, hand tremors and other neurological symptoms. Evidence
suggests that children are particularly susceptible to adverse effects from exposure to pesticides, including
neuro—developmental effects. People may also be exposed to pesticides in a variety of settings including
 homes, schools, hospitals and work places.
</p>

<h1>
	5.4.2.1 Alternatives to Pesticides
</h1>
<p>
. Using biotic pest controls such as pheromones and microbial pesticides
. Genetic engineering
. Following methods of interfering with insect breeding
. Applying composted waste
. Crop rotation, poly culture (cultivating multiple types of plants)
. Planting crops in areas where pests that damage them do not live
. Timing plantation according to when pests will be least problematic
. Use of trap crops that attract pests away from the real crop
. Spraying hot water at a cost that is about same as pesticide spraying
. Release of other organisms that fight pests

</p>

<h1>
	6.1 VALUES EMBEDDED IN VARIOUS RELIGIONS
</h1>
<p>
	A religion is defined as a particular system of faith and worship. It often involves the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods. The predominant religions of the world are Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Sikhism. Other religions that are followed are Jainism, Judaism, Bahai, Taoism and Confucianism.
</p>

<p>
	While all religions stress the importance of good thoughts, words and deeds, the individual tenets, deities, and system of beliefs may differ from religion to religion. Thus, for example, while in
Islam idolatry is prohibited, in Hinduism we find a pantheon of gods and goddesses. Similarly While
the
Karma theory of Hinduism advocates reincarnation, in Christianity we find the concept of Heaven
 Hell being emphasized. Irrespective of the religion we follow, we should learn to accord respect and
tolerance to other religions and live in harmony with others. Religion should not be a divisive force.
</p>

<p>
	India is the birth place of several religious such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism. About 80% of India's population comprises Hindus. The second most dominant religion is Islam which is followed by about 13% of the population. Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism are other

religions that are practised in India. India is a secular country and citizens enjoy the freedom to practise
the religion of their choice.

</p>


<h1>
	6.1.1 Values Embedded in Hinduism
</h1>
<p>

   Hinduism is the oldest religion in the world.It is the dominant religion in india and consists of several diverse traditions, notably, Shaivism (worship of Shiva as the supreme God), Vaishnavism

	(worship of Vishnu as the supreme God) and Shaktism (worship of Devi, the Divine Mother). Major
scriptures include the Vedas, Upanishads, Puranas, Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita. The
term ‘Hindu’ Was originally a geographic term and referred to people who lived beyond the river
Sindhu or Indus. The term ‘Hinduism’ was introduced in the 19th century to denote the religious,
philosophical and cultural traditions followed in India.
</p>

“ Unlike other religions in the world, the Hindu religion does not claim any one
Prophet, it does not worship any one God, it does not believe in any One philosophic

concept ..... in fact, it does not satisfy the traditional features of a religion or creed. It is a
way of life and nothing more".- Supreme Court of India
</p>

<p>
	Followers refer to Hinduism as Sanatana Dharma, the ‘eternal law’ or the ‘eternal way’.
The  Sanatana Dharma enjoins Hindus to practise honesty, self-restraint, generosity, goodwill,
mercy and purity.

<h1>
	6.1.1.2 Some Core Beliefs of Hinduism
</h1>

<p>
	According to scholars, while there is a wide variation in the beliefs and practices of different
sects of Hinduism, there are certain core beliefs shared by all Hindus. These are:

1. Belief in the divinity of the Vedas
2. The universe is an endless cycle of creation, preservation and dissolution. Lord Brahma brings
about creation, Lord Vishnu maintains the universe and Lord Shiva represents the principle of
dissolution and re-creation. Together they form the Trinity.
3. An individual creates his own destiny by his thoughts, words and deeds. This law of cause and
 effect is called Karma.
4. Every soul evolves through a series of births and deaths (janma and punarjanma) until all
karmas have been resolved. The cycle of many births (samskara) is the opportunity to shed the
effects of karma in order to attain liberation (moksha) from the eternal cycle.
5. A master or a guru is essential to follow the right path.
6. All forms of life are sacred and should be loved and revered. All must follow the practice of ‘non injury’ or ahimsa.

<p>
	7. Belief in the existence of divine beings in unseen worlds. Temple worship, rituals, chanting of mantras such as Gayatri mantra, and personal devotion are ways to create a communication with God.

8. No single particular religion teaches the 'only pathway' to salvation. There may be several ways to salvation, including Bhakti marga (devotion and self-surrender), Ganga marga (knowledge or study of philosophical texts and contemplation) and Karma Yoga matga (Action or the proper
performance of one’s religious and ethical duties).
9. Belief in the Supreme Principle or Being (Paramatma), the individual soul or living entity
(Jeevatma) and the cosmic soul (Atma). While Adi Sankaracharya, the founder of 'Advaita' philosophy proclaimed that Jeevatma and Paramatma are identical (not Two but One),
Madhvacharya, the exponent of 'Dvaita' (Two) philosophy declared that the two are eternally different and Ramanujacharya, the founder of Visishtadvaita (not Two-in a special way)
proclaimed that the two are different and yet not different.

(from "Dancing with Siva”, by Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami)

<h1>
	6.1.1.3 Systems of Hindu Philosophy and Texts of Vedanta
</h1>

<p>
	There are six orthodox systems or darshans of Hindu philosophy which accept the Vedas as
the supreme revealed scriptures. They are Nyaya, Visashika, Samkhya, Yoga, Poorva Mimansa and
Uttara Mimansa or Vedanta ( veda+ anta, end of the Vedas). Vedanta forms the basis of most modern
forms of Hinduism. The three fundamental texts of Vedanta are the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita
the Brahma Sutras, which are a commentary on the Upanishads.
</p>

<h1>
	6.1.1.4 Ethical and Moral Teachings in the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita
</h1>
<p>

The term 'Upanishad' means sitting near (a teacher) to recieve sacred teachings.Of the 108
Upanishads that are extant, 12 are considered the principal ones, including the Katha Upanishad, Kena, Isha, Prasna, Chandogya, Mandukya and Aitareya. All the Upanishads are associated with one of the four Vedas-Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda and form the last part of a Veda.
</p>

<p>
    While the main focus in the Upanishads is on attaining Brahma Gnan or Supreme Knowledge which alone can ensure Moksha, we find the texts are also a compendium of morals. Thus, we are exhorted to lead an enlightened and ideal life. Self control, obedience to elders, generosity, benevolence,reverence to the guru and to guests, respect for food which is seen as a personification of parabrahma,adherence to Truth and right conduct are some of the virtues that are extolled. One who does not denounce evil can never attain knowledge. We are repeatedly cautioned, as in the Brahadaranyaka
Upanishad, about Illusion or Maya which causes attachment to worldly objects. It is only When we
 remove the veil of maya  that ignorance vanishes, desire ceases, selfishness ends and all misery disappears. The six deadly passions or arishadvarga should be shunned. They include kama (lust),krodha (anger), lobha (greed), moha (attachment), mada (arrogance) and matsarya (jealousy).

<p>
	The Bhagavad Gita, set in the narrative framework of the Mahabharat, is composed of 700 verses spread over 18 chapters.It is in the form of a dialogue between Arjuna and lord Krishna. Arjuna,the valiant Pandava prince, is overcome by grief at the prospect of waging battle against his
cousins,the Kauravas. He is exhorted by Lord Krishna, his charioteer and guide, to fulfill his duty without attachment. The Gita's message of selfless action is a source of perennial inspiration and is relevant for all ages and times. There are several commentaries which analyze in great depth various aspects of the Gita such as delineation of the concepts of Dharma, Bhakti, Yoga, Samkhya and Moksha. But, put in simple terms, the essence of the Gita is that we should do our duty for its own
sake, Without any expectation of reward. This is a message which is particularly useful for youth.
</p>
<p>
	 A similar teaching is echoed in the second verse of the Ishavasya Upanishad:

 "Seek not the Truth by abandoning this world/Or by renouncing all your bounden
 duties/This is indeed not the path of salvation/Rather, desire ye to live a full life of a
hundred years / Actively engaged in the selfless performance/ of your duties and
 enjoined actions at all times....”
</p>

<h1>
	6.1.1.5 Ethical and Moral Values in the Ramayana and Mahabharata
</h1>
<p>
	The Ramayana is one of the most epics of Hinduism. Written by Valmiki, it consists of
24,000  verses in seven books. It is the story of Lord Rama’s exile and the abduction of Sita by the demon king, Ravana and what follows. The epic is a portrayal of the ideal code of conduct. Rama, considered by Hindus as the incarnation of Lord Vishnu, embodies the 16 qualities of an ideal man. He is a strict adherent of Dharma.As an obedient son, he willingly gets exiled from the kingdom for 14
years in order to keep the word given by his father, Dasratha, to his (Dasratha’s) wife, Kaikeyi. He is Maryada Puroshottama, one who shoWs the utmost reverence for traditions. He is also an ideal ruler.
Bharat and Lakshman are ideal brothers and Sita, the epitome of wifely devotion, purity and virtue.Hanuman is the embodiment of self-surrender.
</p>
<p>
	The Ramayana also deals with values like friendship,mercy and benevolence. Thus, we have the portrayal of the friendship between Rama and sugreeeva, the mercy shown by Rama to the unarmed Ravana on an occasion in the battle-field and the compassion with which Rama eats the berries which have been already tasted by the old woman, Shabari. We learn from the epic about the consequences
of making  promises rashly and what happens When a person, who is virtuous in all other ways, loses his
reason and abducts a pious lady against her will. Dasratha dies, pining for his son, while Ravana is killed in war,
thereby meeting an inglorious end.
</p>

<p>
	The Mahabharatha is the longest epic in the world. Written by Vyasa, it consists of
	100,000

slokas. It centres on the struggle for sovereignty between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, who were cousins, and the ensuing Battle of Kurukshetra. The epic is a treatise on Dharma and contains myriads of small stories within stories. The Aranya Parva, in which Yuddhishtara answers the queries of the Yaksha, is an exposition on values and ethics.

	The incidents in every chapter of the Mahabharatha throw open fer discussion and analysis
 questions dealing With morality, behaviOur and ethical values. The righteousness of Yuddhishtara, the

of Bheeshma fill us with wonder while the evil nature of Duryodhana, the cunning of Shakuni and the

	The Mahabharatha contains an elaborate exposition of the social code. The aims or ends that
are sought by man are described as Purushartha. The four purusharthas are Dharma (righteousness),
Artha (prosperity), Kama (desire) and Moksha (spiritual liberation). Artha means ‘that which One seeks'.
It refers to the job one has, wealth, property and material aspects. Kama or desire is intertwined with
artha. Man seeks pleasures in life and derives joy from material objects and relationships. He uses artha
to satisfy kama. HoWever, man should not deviate from dharma. Dharma means ‘to sustain’ or 'to
Support’. Dharma is the backbone of society It defines the duties and responsibilities of man, both as an
individual and as a member of society. Moksha, derived from the root ‘muk’, means ‘to release’ or 'be
 free’. Moksha is the ultimate goal in life. Once man overcomes avidya or ignorance, he will no longer be
attached to worldly objects. He will attain the highest knowledge and his soul becomes liberated.

<h1>
	6.1.2 Ethical Values in Islam
</h1>

<p>
	 The literal meaning of Islam is submission. In the religious sense the word Islam means submission
to the Will ofAllah the Almighty and obedience to His Law. Only through submission to the Will of the
Almighty and by obedience to His Law can one achieve true peace and enjoy lasting purity.
</p>
<p>

  Islamic teachings are broadly divided into two parts: Theory and Practice. The theoretical
part is related to faith. The true faithful Muslim believes in the following articles of faith:

1. He believes in one God, Supreme and Eternal, Infinite and Mighty, Merciful and
Compassionate, Creator and Provider. This belief, in order to be effective, requires complete

trust and hope in God, submission to His will and reliance on His aid. It secures man’s dignity

and saves him from fear and despair, from guilt and confusion.

2. He believes in all the messengers of God without any discrimination among them. The
 messengers are the great teachers of the good and champions of the right. They were
chosen by God to teach mankind and to deliver His divine message.

3.  The true Muslim believes in all the scriptures and revelations of God.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page00072">72</pagenum>
<h1>
	 page no : 72
</h1>
<p>
4. The true Muslim believes that the angles of God are spiritual and splendid beings. They have no physical desire of any kind nor material needs. They spend their days and nights in the service of God.

5. The true Muslim believes in the last Day of judgement.This world will come to an end some
day, and the dead will rise to stand for their final and fair trial. Every thing we do in this world, every intention we have, every move we make is counted and kept in accurate records. On
 the day of Judgment they will be brought up. People with good records will be generously rewarded and warmly welcomed to the Heaven of God, and those with bad records will be punished and cast to Hell.

6.The true Muslim believes in the timeless knowledge of God and His power to plan and execute His plans. God is not indifferent to this World nor is He neutral to it. His knowledge
 and power are in action at all times to keep order in His vast domain and maintain full
command over His creation. He is wise and loving and whatever He does must have a good motive and a meaningful purpose.
</p>
<p>

<p>
	Anyone who has belief in the above articles is considered to be a true believer and a person

who  denies or rejects any one of the above things is considered to be a disbeliever.
</p>

The Second part of Islam is practical. This part ordains that every Muslim should execute
certain exercises in his practical life to substantiate his faith. They are:

1. Offering prayers fivetimes daily to show his submissiveness and obedience to the Almighty.

2. Observing one month fasting in the 9th month of every lunar year i e. Ramzan.
3. Paying two and half percent ofhis surplus wealth towards Zakat (alms or charity) every year

to the poor and needy relatives and neighbours.


4. Performing Hajj once in a life provided he is competent enough to bear the expenditure of

the journey and provide basic amenities to the family members.
</p>
<h1>
	6.1.2.1  Sources of Islamic Teachings
</h1>

<p>
	There are two sources of Islamic teachings they are: The Holy Qur’an and the Sunnah (Method)
of the  Prophet. The Qur’an is the divine word revealed to the Prophet Mohammed as His last and final word. The Sunnah is nothing but the practical application of the Qur’anic injunctions. Thus it is believed that the Qur’an is the text and the Sunnah is its commentary. The Sunnah is the complementary part of the Qur'an without which nobody can understand the message of the Holy Qur’an.

<pagenum page="normal" id="page00073">73</pagenum>

<h1>
	6.1.2.2 Moral and Value system of Islam, page no : 73
</h1>
<p>
	Islam has laid down some universal fundamental rights for humanity as a whole, which are to be observed and respected under all circumstances. To achieve these rights Islam provides not only
legal safeguards but also a very effective moral System. Thus whatever leads to the welfare of the
individual or the society is morally good in Islam and whatever is injurious is morally bad. Islam attaches
so much importance to the love of God and love of man that it warns against too much of formalism.
</p>

<p>
		We are given four heads:

. Our faith should be true and sincere
. We must be prepared to show it in deeds of charity to our fellow-men
. We must be good citizens, supporting social organizations
. Our own individual soul must be firm and unshaken in all circumstances
</p>

      <p>
	Divine revelations are the primary source of knowledge. Through belief in God and the Day
 of Judgement Islam furnishes a force which enables a person to adopt the moral conduct with earnestness
 and sincerity, with all the devotion of heart and soul.

	6.1.2.3 Social Responsibilities
</h1>

 <p>
	The teachings of Islam concerning social responsibilities are based on kindness and consideration to others.
Islam lays emphasis on specific acts of kindness and defines the responsibilities and rights of
various relationships. In a Widening circle of relationship, then, our first obligation is to our
immediate
family- parents, husband or wife and children, then to other relatives, neighbours, friends , and
acquaintances, orphans and widows, the needy of the community, our fellow Muslims, all our fellow
human beings and animals.

</p>
<p>
	Respect and care for parents is greatly stressed in the Islamic teaching and is a very important
part of a MuSlim’s expression of faith.
</p>

<h1>
	6.1.2.4 The Concept of Equality
</h1>
<p>

Islam teaches that, in the sight of god, all men are equal, but they are not necessarily identical
There are differences of abilities ,potentials, ambitions, wealth, and so on. Yet none of these differences
 can by itself establish a status of superiority of one man or race to another. The only distinction Which  God recognizes is the distinction in piety, and the only criterion which God applies is the criterion of
goodness and spiritual excellence.

<h1>
	6.1.2.6 The Concept of Universal Brotherhood,page no : 74
</h1>
<p>
	 Another fundamental element in the value system of Islam is the value of human brotherhood. Human
 brotherhood in Islam is based on an unshakable belief in Oneness and Universality of God the
worshipped, the unity of mankind and worshippers, and the unity of religion, the medium of
worship. For
the  Muslim, God is One, Eternal and Universal. He is the creator of all men, the provider for all men, the
judge  of all men, and the Lord over all men. To Him, social status, national supermanship, and racial origin
are insignificant. Before Him, all men are equal and brothers of one another.

<h1>
	6.1.3 Ethics in Christianity
</h1>
<p>
	 Christianity is the world's largest religion with approximately 2.2 billion followers. It is a
monotheistic religion (belief in a single all-powerful god), based on the life and teachings of
Jesus as presented in the New Testament of the Bible. Christians refer to Jesus as Christ or the Messiah, the
promised saviour. Christianity began as a Jewish sect in the mid-1st century and gradually spread to the rest of the world through missionary work and colonization.
</p>


<p>
	The Gospels are the written accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus. The Gospels of
Mathew, Mark, Luke and John are considered canonical or authentic religious texts. The Apostles’

Creed is the most popular statement of the articles of the Christian faith which are acceptable to most
Christian  denominations. The main points include:

. Belief in God the Father, Jesus Christ as the son of God, and the Holy Spirit

. The death, resurrection and ascension of Christ

. Christ's Second Coming the Day of Judgement and salvation of the faithful
</p>

<p>
	 The cornerstone of Christianity is that through belief in the death and resurrection of
	 Jesus,

sinful  humans can be reconciled to God and, thereby, Can attain salvation and the promise of eternal life.

</p>

<p>
	The Bible contains numerous narrative accounts of ethical relevance and also lays down laws of conduct. Of particular significance are the Ten Commandments, the Beatitudes and the Golden Rule.
</p>

<h1>
	6.1.3.1 Ten Commandments, page no : 75
</h1>
<p>
	The ten Commandments, contained in the old Testament, are a set of key principle relating to ethics and worship.
They are found in the Books of Exodus and Deuteronomy. These Commandments
were inscribed by God on two stone tablets and given to Moses on Mount Sinai. They include:
1. I am the Lord thy God
   Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
2. Thou shalt not make unto any graven image.
3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord in vain.
4. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
5. Honour thy father and thy mother.
6. Thou shalt not kill.
7. Thou shalt not commit adultery.
8. Thou shalt not steal.
9. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house or thy neighbour's wife or animals.


</p>

<h1>
	6.1.3.2 The Beatitudes
</h1>
<p>

The word ‘beatitude’ comes from a Latin word which means ‘blessedness’. In Christianity
the Eight Beatitudes are a set of teachings by Jesus that appear in the Gospel of Mathew, the first book
of the New Testament of the Bible. They present a set of Christian ideals that focus on a spirit of love
and humility, mercy, spirituality and compassion. The Beatitudes describe a way of life that promises
salvation, not in this World, but in the next. Some of the oft-quoted ones are:

. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
</p>

<h1>
	6.1.3.3 The Golden Rule
</h1>

<p>
	The Golden Rule refers to a well known verse in the Gospel of Mathew in the New Testament
and is a part of the sermon on the Mount. The verse in considered to be a summation of the entire
sermon delivered by Jesus:

“So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law
and the Prophets.”

 Thus, it is not enought merely to refrain from harming others. We are exhorted to work actively
for the good of others, including our enemies, and treat everyone with the same love and compassion
that  we would ourselves like to receive.

	6.1.4 Values Embedded in Buddhism
</h1>
<p>

Buddhism is a religion which originated in India in the 6th century B.C.It is a non-theist religion as there is
no belief in a Supreme Being or God. It is based on the
teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, commonly known as
the Buddha or Enlightened One. There are two schools of
 Buddhism---- Theravada and Mahayana, both of which
spread throughout various countries in Asia. It is estimated
that there are about 500 million Buddhists worldwide
today.
</p>
<p>

 Gautama was born in a princely family in 563B.C in Lumbini, a town in modern day Nepal,
to Suddhodana and Mayadevi. It was prophesied that he would become either a great king or a monk.
At the age of 29 Gautama Went beyond the palace walls and came face to face with suffering for the
first time in his life. He saw an old man, a sickman, a corpse and, finally, an ascetic. Moved by the
experience, Gautama abandoned his kingly life and also left his wife, Yashodhara and son, Rahul, to
seek enlightenment. In his spiritual quest he met many renowned teachers and subjected himself to
severe penance, almost starving himself to death. He realized that self mortification Was not the answer.
At the age of 35 he sat under a boddhi tree in Gaya and meditated for several days. It was there that he
became enlightened and was, thereafter, called the Buddha. He delivered sermons and taught the path of awakening.
</p>

<h1>
	6.1.4.1 Teachings of Buddhism
</h1>
<p>
	The Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path

The Four Noble Truths are central to the beliefs of Buddhism. They are:
1. Dukha: There is Dukha or suffering
2. Dukha Samudhaya(Origin of Suffering): There is a cause for Suffering. Wants or desires are the reason for Suffering. In a larger sense, Ignorance is the root of all Suffering.
3. Dukha Nirodha (Cessation of Suffering): Suffering can be stopped.
4. Dukha Nirodha Marga (Path to stop Suffering): There is a way to stop Suffering.
</p>

<p>
	 In Buddhism Samsara is defined as the continual repetitive cycle of birth and death that
takes place because of the ignorance of the being. Samsara is fraught with suffering. This

<p>
	suffering and cycle of rebirth can be broken by following the Arya Astanga Marga or
Eightfold Path. This includes:

Right Understanding, Right Aspiration, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right
Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Meditation.

(Samyak Dhrushti, Samyak Sankalpa, Samyak Vakku, Samyak Karma, Samyak
Jeevan, Samyak Vyayama, Samyak Smruthi and Samyak Samadhi)
</p>
<p>

Buddhists believe in the Middle Path or the path of moderation between self indulgence
and self mortification. They seek refuge in the Three Jewels----Buddha, Dharma
(Teachings) and Sangha (Community).
</p>
<p>

Buddhism advocates the adherence to Five precepts. These are not in the nature of
commandments. Rather, they are guiding principles. Buddhists are expected to:

1. Avoid taking the life of beings 2. Avoid taking things not given 3. Avoid sensual misconduct
4. Refrain from false speech: 5. Abstain from substances that cause intoxication.

Buddhism lays importance on meditation and development of mindfulness. A person who is
seeking the state of Buddha or enlightenment is called Bodhisattva.
</p>
<p>
	Buddha was not only a spiritual leader but a radical social reformer. He condemned contemporary social evils like the rigid caste system and the practice of elaborate religious rituals and animal sacrifice. He advocated the upliftment of women through education. He believed in the need to sustain natural resources and exhorted his disples to plant at least one tree every year. He emphasized that governance should be based on humanitarian priniciples and should be free from corruption. Buddha's views on the moral duties of rulers greatly inspired Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century B.C.

	6.1.5 Ethical values in Jainism
</h1>

<p>
	Jainism is an ancient religion which lays great emphasis on the principle of ahimsa or non-violence towards all living beings and equality among all forms of life. There are about 4million Jains in India today. The
word Jainism is derived from jin, which
means ‘to conquer’. The conquering of
passions and desires is a cardinal principle
of Jainism. Those who are Successful in
achieving self-control and detachment
are called jinas. Though Vardhamana

century BC, is regarded as the most influential teacher of Jainism, he was not the founder of the religion. He was, in fact, the 24th in the successive line of tirthankaras or propagators of the faith. The role of
 tirthankaras was to help people attain salvation by offering spiritual guidance.

</p>
<p>
	There are two major sects in Jainism—Digambara and Swetambara. Digambara monks do
not wear clothes as they believe that they should abjure all worldly possessions. Women are not allowed
to join this sect. Swetambara monks dress in white flowing robes. Women ascetics of this sect are
called sadhvis and are accorded great respect.
</p>

<h1>
	6.1.5.1 Teachings of Jainism
</h1>
<p>

Jainism proclaims that the universe was never created nor will it cease to exist. It is independent and self-sufficient. There is no superior power or Supreme Being which sustains
it. The cosmic wheel of time, called kalachakra rotates without a pause. It is divided into two halves---Utsarpini and Avasarpini.
The former is a period of prosperity and happiness while the latter is a period of increasing Sorrow. The
 soul is pure and possesses infinite knowledge, bliss and energy. However, the purity of the soul is
defiled by association with karma, just as gold is defiled by impurities. The soul can be released from
the bondage of karma by attaining enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	 Jainism is a religion which discourages dogma and the rigid clinging to a set of principles and traditions.Rather, acceptance of multiplicity of viewpoints is actively encouraged. The views and beliefs
 of rival religions are not dismissed but tolerated. The notion that there can be different approaches to
truth and reality is called anekantavada and was propagated mainly by Mahavira. The duties of a Jain
 include respecting teachers and monks, praising tirthankaras, introspecting, practising serenity and
stillness, and renunciation. Some of the principal tenets and practices of Jainism are:
</p>

<h1>
	6.1.5.2  Non-Violence
</h1>

<p>
	 Non-violence or ahimsa is the most distinctive features of jain religious practice. It does not
merely mean abstaining from Violence. Rather, the principle is applied in every aspect of everyday
 activities, especially with regard to food. Jains believe that even the smallest insects should not be
harmed. Jains are strict vegetarians and avoid onions and garlic. Some do not eat root vegetables like
the potato. The reason is that tiny organisms may be injured when the bulbs or tubers are pulled out of
the soil. Strict adherents of Jainism are vegans and do not consume dairy products like milk. Honey is
forbidden Jains eat plants for sustenance but believe that one should not harm plants more than What is
absolutely necessary. Jains cover their mouths with a cloth and avoid going out after dusk as they may
unitentionally trample on small insects and micro-organisms. The mouth-covering also serves as a
reminder to talk with courtesy. Harsh speech is viewed as a form of violence. Violence in self-defence
is, however, justified.



</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00079">79</pagenum>

<h1>
	6.1.5.3 Self-Control, page no : 79
</h1>
<p>
	Jainism lays a lot of emphasis on self-control. Ascetics are expected to follow more rigorous standards of self-control. They have to undertake five major vows which include :

1. Ahimsa:  The ascetic vows not to harm other living beings, either intentionally or unintentionally.

2. Satya: Truth must be followed at all times. In a situation where speaking the truth could lead
 to Violence, silence is to be observed.

3. Asteya: This implies not only refraining from theft but not accepting anything that is not willingly offered.

4. Brahmacharya: Control over the senses should be exercised.

5. Aparigraha: The  word means non-possessiveness. Detachment from people and objects should
be developed.
</p>

<h1>
	6.1.5.4 Prayer and Meditation
</h1>

 <p>
	Jainism places a lot of importance on meditation. It is believed that meditation helps one to
control passions and thoughts. The type of meditation practised by Jains is called Samayika. The aim
of Samayika is to understand eternal truths and attain bliss. Jains chant a prayer called the Namokara
mantra. No god is invoked, nor any tirthankara. No favours are beseeched. The mantra is an offering
of reverence to spiritually elevated beings. It is the means through which one can overcome worldly
attachments and attain salvation or moksha. There are no priests. Jainism encourages monasticism.
Monks lead a a Spartan life and go barefoot from place to place, accepting the food given by others.
</p>

<h1>
	6.1.5.5 Fasting
</h1>

<p>
    Fasting, particularly during festivals, is an important practice in jainism. A unique ritual in
	Jainism is a holy fast unto death, called sallekhana or santhara. A person who believes that his worldly
duties are over may undertake such a fast, slowly reducing food and water over a period of t1me, till he
finally dies. The process may take more than a decade and is greatly revered among Jains. It is believed
that one can shed bad karma through this practice and attain moksha.

	6.1.6 Values embedded in Sikhism
</h1>











<pagenum page="normal" id="page00080">80</pagenum>
<h1>
	 page no : 80
</h1>
<p>
	Sikhism is a religion that was founded in punjab during the 15th century by Guru Nanak. He was
followed by ten successive Sikh gurus. Guru Granth Sahib is the holy book of Sikhs. It comprises
more than 1400 pages. It was originally called the Adigranth and consisted of hymns in praise of God.
It was compiled by the fifth guru, Arjan Devji. During the 17th century the tenth guru, Gobind Singh,
added the compositions of his predecessor, Guru Tegh Bahadur and affirmed that the book would be
own successor and Would be a ‘living guru’ for all time. The book Was renamed Guru Granth Sahib ji
and is considered to be the eleventh and last guru of Sikhism. There are about 30 million Sikhs in the world today.
</p>

<h1>
	6.1.6.1 Teachings of Sikhism
</h1>

<p>
	Sikhism, a monotheistic religion, asserts that the cosmos was created by the will of God. God is shapeless, timeless and cannot be seen. He is omnipresent and omnipotent but can be reached only by
those who are spiritually enlightened. There is no concept of Heaven or Hell in Sikhism. Salvation or
jeevanmukthi lies in union with the akaal or Timeless One. Maya or illusion distracts one from the
goal and prevents one from achieving this union, but can be dispelled by the grace or mehar of
God.
Meditation or simran, along with the chanting of God’s name or japu, helps one in spiritual progress.
Good company or satsang is greatly beneficial for spirituality and helps one to break free from the
cycle of rebirth.
</p>
<p>

Guru Nanak asserted that while realization of Truth is important, more important is Truthful
living. Spiritual and secular life are intertwined 1n Sikhism and asceticism is discouraged. A life of purity,
self-control and truthfulness is deemed superior to a purely contemplative life. Guru Hargobind, the
sixth guru, stated succinctly that the temporal or Miri and the spiritual or Piri realms should
co-exist.
The same idea was echoed by the ninth guru, Tegh Bahadur, who said that Sikhs should develop both
shakti (power) as well as bhakti (devotion). Sikhism ordains that one should fight oppression, injustice
and the violation of Dharma. Thus, we have the concept of the sant-sipahi (saint-soldier). All Sikhs are enjoined to carry kirpans or swords on their person at all times.
</p>
<p>

 Guru Nanak emphasized the concept of service. Seva or service is as important as simran.
He established the System of the Langar or community kitchen which symbolizes the spirit of sharing
and  equality. Even today the langar is an integral part of the gurudwara, the place of worship of Sikhs.
People of all faiths are welcome. Sikhs are expected to serve humanity vith their tan man and dhan
i.e body, mind and wealth. Sikhism declares that all men are created equal and shuns discrimination
based on caste, creed or gender. Women are accorded equal rights as men. Sikhism is a liberal religion

and  asserts that all religions can enlighten their followers.
</p>
<p>

 Sikhism cautions followers about the dangers of Five Inner Thieves or weaknesses which should be quelled. They are kama (lust), krodh (anger), lobh (greed), moh (infatuation) and

 ahankar (ego). These vices can be subdued by changing the name of God, engaging in community services and following the Five Virtues of Truth, Compassion, Love, Contentment and Humanity. Sikhism
prohibits followers from indulging in certain practices such as cutting one’s hair(men too must grow their hair), consuming alcohol and drugs, following superstitions and meaningless
rituals, and being obsessed
with wealth. Practices like sati and animal sacrifice are forbidden. Sikhs are encouraged to live as saint-
soldiers and not as monks or ascetics. They should lead a life free from blemish by following the highest standards of morality.
</p>

<h1>
	6.2 RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE
</h1>
<p>

 “ The whole purpose of religion is to facilitate love and
compassion, patience, tolerance, humility, forgiveness ” ----Dalai Lama

“Rivers, ponds, lakes and streams - they all have different
names, but they all contain water. Just as religions do - they all

contain truths ” ----Muhammed Ali
</p>

<p>
	 Gandhiji said that character can be developed by sincerely following one's religion.
</p>

<p>
	Dr.Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan believed that without religion man cannot be enlightened. Qualities
like truth, self-control, humility and detachment can be inculcated only through religion. Religion is the
foundation of ethical life. It is natural for every person to take pride in his religion and feel it is the best.
In a democracy people of all faiths have the freedom to follow the religion of their choice and observe
all the customs and rituals associated with it. However, this does not give one the right to look down on
other religions or treat people of other religions with contempt or suspicion as this will lead to social
disharmony and unrest.
</p>
<p>

In India, people of diiferent religions, castes, tribes, sects live together.They should understand the essence of all religions and realize that religion helps to lead a value-based life. The essence of all
religions is the same. Religious integrity can be attained by establishing peace, helping the neighbourhood,
living ethically, showing love towards all and developing fraternity among all the religions. It is heartening
to note that communal riots and religious disturbances have been on the decline during the last few years.

<h1>
	7 .1 NEED AND IMPORTANCE OF PROFESSIONAL ETHICS
</h1>
<p>

While the word ‘professional’ can loosely be used to refer to anyone who holds a job, it is
generally used in a more restrictive sense. It refers to well-educated workers who possess Specialized
skills and knowledge and who are engaged in creative and intellectually challenging work. Doctors,
engineers, scientists, lawyers and educationists are common examples of professionals. Most
professionals are required to follow strict codes of conduct. These standards of morality and prOfessional
conduct are laid down by professional associations pertaining to that particular field. The purpose of
the code of conduct is to preserve the integrity of the profession and ensure that the public is protected
from exploitation and deception. Thus, Professional Ethics can be defined as the personal, organizational
and corporate standards of behaviour expected of professionals. While some of the provisions of the
code are enforceable by law, the rest serve as guidelines. The disciplinary body of the particular
association, however, can pass strictures or even take appropriate action against professionals who
violate the provisions of the code.
</p>

<h1>
	7 .2 GOALS
</h1>

<p>
	Professionals enjoy high status and respect in society. The exalted standing of the professional finds mention even in the ancient scriptures. The doctor is equated to Lord Narayana and the teacher to
the Trinity of gods. It is not surprising, therefore, that professionals are expected to follow exemplary
standards of behaviour in their dealings with clients as well as with other members of the fraternity. They
are expected to be motivated by the Spirit of public service and concern for the underprivileged rather than
concentrate on accumulating personal wealth. Integrity, objectivity, accountability, confidentiality and

7.3 ETHICAL VALUES IN VARIOUS PROFESSIONS
7.3.1 Ethics in Corporate Management
</h1>
<p>

   Corporate management can be defined as the process of leading, administering and directing
a company. In the past traditional business houses and companies were concerned mainly with how to
make the maximum profit and returns on investment. They were not particularly concerned about the
social environmental effects of the business activities or about issues related to the welfare of employees .
It was enough if the company functioned within the purview of the law. However, a perceptible change
started taking place in the 1980s. It was felt that merely conforming to the law was not enough. Many
companies framed social responsibility charters and declared their commitment to ethical practices of
conducting business. No longer did the words of the famous philosopher and pioneer of Political
Economics, Adam Smith, hold true: “All for ourselves, and nothing for other people, seems, in every

age of the world, to have been the vile maxim of the masters of mankind" .
</p>
<p>

  A Business Ethics Management System is a “set of interdependent policies. processes and
procedures that a company uses to conduct its operations legally, ethically and consistent with its
values”. Ethical issues include the rights and duties between a company and its employees, customers
or clients, share-holders, competitors and the general public. It encompasses diverse areas and issues
such  as protection of the environment. employee welfare measures, fair trade practices and  marketing
strategies, transparency about potential health risks, financial risks or safety risks of
products, correct

declaration of revenues and profits and so on.

	The United Nations Global Compact is an initiative taken by the United Nations to encourage
businesses in all countries to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies. Launched in 2000, it
contains ten principles or core values in the areas of human rights, environment and anti- corruption
which all companies are asked to comply with. These principles include:

1. Support of human rights and prevention of human rights abuse

2. Recognition of the right to collective bargaining

3. Elimination of forced labour, especially child labour

4. Avoidance of discrimination In respect of employment on the grounds of age, sex,
nationality or religion

which may be both tangible and intangible. Sometimes the beneﬁts may be apparent only in the long
run. Some of the advantages of corporate responsibility are:
</p>
<p>

1. Competitive Advantage and Reputation:

 Customers as well as investers are increasingly favouring companies that follow ethical
practices. Companies which violate human rights face a lot of flak and negative publicity which
may, in
turn, lead to decrease in market share and shrinking profits. For example -

a)  In 2002 a report highlighted the poor working conditions and use of child labour in six
factories in China, in which footwear was being manufactured for the U.S based Reebok
International Limited, the. undisputed leader of footwear. There was a public outcry and the
company image took a beating. Remedial steps were taken and Doug Cahn, the Director of
Human Rights Programmes. Reebok, affirmed “ .... we’re a global corporation and we have

an obligation to give back to the communities in which we live and work”.

b) Many women use only those cosmetic products which have not been tested or used on animals.
 Companies which do not use animals for testing cosmetics, therefore, prominently advertise
the fact L’oreal, despite being included in the Forbes list of the world ’s most ethical companies

 in 2014, is boycotted in some places as it is silent or vague on the use of animals for testing

some of its products.

c) One reason why Microsoft is such a reputed company is that it donates one billion dollars
every year to non-profit organizations throughout the world. In India, Tata Sons, Infosys
and Wipro are some companies which are held in high esteem because of the philanthropic

work their founders have initiated.

d)  Starbucks, a popular coffee chain, is lauded for the use of recycled paper for its cups. It
encourages consumers to be environmentally conscious by offering a 10 cent discount to

those who bring their own reusable cup.

 Employees who are paid well and given medical facilities, housing, educational and recreational
opportunities would hesitate to leave the company. The financial and emotional security leads to greater
productivity and loyalty to the company. Jamsetji Tata (1839-1904), considered the Father of Indian
Industry, set up TISCO (now called Tata Steel) in a small village in Bihar. A visionary and philanthropist,
he built a township there with housing, hospitals and schools for the workers. “Be sure that there is
plenty of space for lawns and gardens. Reserve large areas for football, hockey and parks. Earmark
 areas for Hindu temples, Mohammedan mosques and Christian churches”, he wrote in a letter to
his son. The village developed into a town and was called Jamshedpur. Even today the Tata group of
companies is reputed to be one of the best companies to work for, with low rates of attrition. Another
Tata company, TELCO, was the first Indian company to hire women engineers, thus taking a major
step towards ending gender discrimination at the work place.

<h1>
	7.3.2 Ethics in Business, Industry, Finance, Sales
</h1>

 <p>
	It is not just large corporate houses that should follow a model code of ethics and social
 responsibility. Whether one is a businessman or a salesman or a contractor or a tailor, one should adopt
ethical practices at work. Profit should not be the sole motivating factor. Given below are some of the

ethical practices that should be followed in business:

1. Children should not be employed. In fact, child labour is not only unethical but illegal. In India it
is common to find children working in hotels and petrol bunks. In Sivakasi children less than five
years are made to work long hours in cramped and dangerous conditions. These children help in
the making of crackers and other fireworks.

2. Adequate wages should be paid to workers and medical facilities provided. Working conditions
must be comfortable and safe. Working hours and holidays should conform to the labour laws.

3. The product being sold should meet the requirements of the client. There is no point in selling a comb to a bald man!

4. Quality control should be maintained. The highest standards should be observed in the manufacture
of goods. A contractor should not use bricks or sand of inferior quality; a vendor should not sell
vegetables or flowers which are not fresh. One of the secrets of the impeccable reputation that
Pullareddy Sweets has built for itself is the stringent standards of quality that it has maintained
over the decades.

5. Goods should be weighed correctly. Traders often cheat customers by using inaccurate weighing
scales. It may not make too much difference to a customer in the case of a packet of sugar, but

6. Harmful colours and preservatives to make food items attractive should be avoided.

7. Artificial scarcity of goods should not be created. Unscrupulous traders hoard goods and hike
prices at opportune times. Governments have fallen because of steep prices of onions due to
hoarding!

8. During times of natural calamities traders should refrain from exploiting people and not sell  goods at exorbitant prices.

9. The duty of a businessman or salesman does not end with selling the product. After-sales service is essential for instilling confidence in the customer.

10. Defective goods should be replaced without harassing the customer.

11. If it is found that a certain batch of goods is defective in some respect, the company should
institute a voluntary recall at the earliest. For example -

a) Some time back Honda, Nissan, Ford and BMW announced a recall of millions of cars
worldwide because of faulty airbags that had been made at a factory in Japan and
used by all these companies. A few airbags had exploded in conditions of heat and
humidity.
b) In 2000 Burger King recalled millions of plastic containers in which Pokemon toys
had been kept and distributed to children as part of a $22million promotion, aftert the
death of a child due to choking on a part of the container.

c) Every now and then pharmaceutical companies recall entire batches of particular
 medicines which have been sold, after some serious side effect or death is reported.”

d) In 1982 Johnson and Johnson recalled 31million bottles of capsules of Tylenol, a
paracetemol, following the death of 7 people in Chicago. These unfortunate people
had consumed Tylenol which had been deliberately tampered with and laced with
cyanide (It remains an unsolved crime). This is the first major recall of a product in
history. Though the company was not at fault the swift decisiveness with which it acted

was commended by all.

12. False claims should not be made about a product. Gullible customers are often desperate enough
to spend thousands on the latest weight loss ‘miracle method’ advertised by a company which
claims one can knock off 20 kg in a couple of months without going under the knife or altering
one’s diet or moving out of the chair! After all, the picture of the girl ‘Before’ and ‘After’ looks so convincing.

13. The various features as well as the pros and cons of different products Should be explained
 clearly to the customer so that he can make a comparative analysis and arrive at an informed
decision. Thus, it would be unethical to convince an old man to buy an expensive smart phone
when all that he is looking for is to speak occasionally to his daughter in Adilabad. If a person
wants to put his savings in a Fixed Deposit for a year it is unethical to sell him a product in which
his money will be blocked for three years.

14. Customers should not be persuaded to buy a certain product merely because it would entail
 greater commission for the agent. A few years back agents pocketed hefty commissions by
aggressively selling thousands of Unit Linked Insurance policies to clients, without educating

them about the risks involved.
15. Pollution and degradation of natural resources should be avoided.

16. All taxes should be duly paid. Accounts should not be fudged.

17. Laws pertaining to business should be followed both in the letter and in the Spirit.

	7.3.3 Ethics in Education
</h1>
<p>

 “If a country is to be free of corruption and a nation of beautiful minds, I

strongly feel there. are three key societal members who can make a difference. They

are the father, the mother and the teacher.” - A. P.J Abdul Kalam
</p>
<p>

 Teachers play a very important role in society. They provide instruction which equips students
with knowledge and skills that enable them to stand on their own feet. They inculcate in students the
spirit of enquiry and creative thinking. Above all, they mould the personality and character of students.
It is difficult to measure the extent of a teacher’s influence on students. As the philosopher Henry
Brooks observed, “A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops”. Ancient
scriptures venerate the teacher as a personification of God. ‘ Guru brahma, guru Vishnu, guru devo

maheswara...’ so goes the incantation.
</p>
<p>

In the rapidly changing scenario of modern times, the image of the teacher has undergone a
metamorphosis. Crass commercialization has become rampant in almost every sphere of life Education
has become a commodity, to be sold at a premium. Schools and colleges have been reduced to coaching
centres and the emphasis is on providing intensive training in certain subjects only, so that the student
gets admission in a coveted institute of higher learning. The importance given to all—round personality
training and the inculcation of morals is diminishing. It is time educationists indulged in introspection and
brought about pivotal changes in this respect.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00089">89</pagenum>

	7.3.3.1 ,page no : 89
</h1>

<p>
	Teachers are expected to maintain high standards of morality, besides being good at their
subject. They should observe certain ethical norms such as:

1. A true teacher is a lifelong learner. He should never feel that he knows everything or that
he is so experienced that he can go without preparation to the class. The teacher should
devote time to ponder the different ways a topic can be dealt with and how to make it
interesting for students, rather than merely dictating notes.

2.  A teacher Should be sensitive to the needs and feelings of students. Every child is unique
and has certain strengths as well as drawbacks. A good teacher draws out the best from
each child.

3. The teacher should never insult a student or demean him by calling him ‘stupid’, ‘dumb'
etc. This can have a crippling effect on the child. The child may be demoralized, sink into
depression and, in extreme cases, even commit suicide. The teacher should also refrain
from making derogatory personal comments such as ‘You, the fat boy in the red shirt... ’ or
‘Tell that dark girl who sits at the back... '

4. The teacher should resort to positive reinforcement and try to avoid punishment as far as
possible. Punishment can be in the form of imposition. In case of repeated intransigence,
parents can be called and the matter discussed. Corporal punishment should be avoided at
all costs as not Only is it ethically unacceptable but is also against the law. Ever so often we
read about shocking incidents such as a child being banged against a wall by a teacher,
being beaten so badly that he suffers bleeding injuries or fractures, or even of a child losing

eye-sight or sense of hearing permanently because of the inhuman behaviour of a teacher.

5. The teacher should be a role model who inspires the respect of the students. Her demeanor,

dress and mode of inter-action with students as well as colleagues should be beyond
reproach. If a teacher frequently uses her mobile phone in class, she loses the moral authority
 to reprimand students when they do the same.





</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00090">90</pagenum>

<p>
	6. The teacher should strive to be a friend, philosopher and guide to students. The relationship
 with students continues beyond the classroom. The teacher should be ready to listen patiently
to the problems and difficulties of students, Whether related to academics or pertaining to
their personal life. Students today face tremendous stress, not only because of the vastness
of the curriculum and fierce competition but because of the high expectations of parents as
well as their own ambitious goals. The stress is further compounded by moral dilemmas
relating to peer pressure, inter-action with the opposite sex and explosion of material
available on social media and the internet. Teachers can play a stabilizing role in the life of
students by showing tolerance, sympathy and compassion.

	7.3.4 Ethics in the Civil Services
</h1>
<p>

 In the system of Parliamentary democracy of India, the ministers are the elected representatives
of the people and are vested with the responsibility of running the administration of the country. However,
 as ministers are not well-versed with the intricacies of administration, they mainly focus on making
 executive decisions. It is the civil servants who are entrusted with the onerous task of implementing the
 details of policy. The civil service, thus, is the backbone of the administration in India. The Indian Civil
Service was formed after independence. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel is referred to as the patron saint of
the civil services. He played an important role in founding the Indian Administrative Service and the

Indian Police Service. He was vocal in stating that civil servants should be free from political influence and vindictiveness.
</p>

<p>
	The Civil Services encompass a Wide range of services at the Central as well as the State
level. Thus apart from IAS and IPS, we have the Indian Foreign Service, Indian Forest Service, Accounts
and Audit Service, Railway Service, Health Service, Engineering Service, Postal Service and Services
relating to Defence, Law, Geology, Meteorology and various other subjects. It is not an exaggeration
to say that the country would come to a grinding halt without the functioning of the Civil Services.
</p>

<h1>
	7.4.4.1
</h1>

<p>
	As civil Servants wield so much power and shoulder so much responsibility it is only befitting
that they should follow the highest standards of integrity and probity both in public as well as in private life. While the Indian constitution does not lay down a specific code of ethics for civil servants, a general
Code of conduct finds mention. Civil servants are required to do the following:

. Discharge official duty with responsibility, honesty,accountability and without discrimination
based on caste, creed, gender or religion.

. Ensure effective management, leadership and development.

. Avoid misuse of official position or information.

. Serve as instruments of good governance and foster social and economic development.

<p>
	The Draft Public Services Bill, 2007 proposes legislation to set up a regulatory and protective
framework for making civil servants work without political interference and persecution. The Bill
emphasizes that public servants should be guided by:

.  Patriotism and national pride
.  Allegiance to the Constitution
.  Objectivity, impartiality, honesty, diligence, courtesy and transparency

</p>
<p>
	The Bill draws inspiration from the Australian code of ethics for public servants. It is proposed
in the Bill that a code of ethics should be laid down for Indian civil servants, which would be enforceable
by law. Some of the qualities that a civil servant should possess, according to the Bill are:

1. Integrity: Civil servants should be guided in their decisions solely by public interest; they

should not make personal profit by accepting money and other favours.

2. Impartiality: Decisions should be based on merit alone.

3. Commitment to public service: Service should be rendered in a fair, effective and courteous
manner.
4. Accountability: Civil servants are accountable for their decisions and should be willing to
subject themselves to scrutiny.

5. Devotion to duty: Civil servants should show unstinting devotion towards their duties.

6. Exemplary behaviour: Civil servants should be a model of good behaviour

	Over the last few decades the Indian bureaucracy has come in for a lot of flak. It has been
criticized for red tapism, inefficiency, cumbersome and archaic rules and procedures, corruption, nepotism,
inordinate delays in approvals and connivance with politicians for personal ends. Sweeping reforms
have been suggested. The main challenge is to free bureaucracy from the grip of corrupt and self
seeking politicians so that civil servants can work confidently without fear or favour.
E-governance can
 go a long way in ensuring transparency. It must never be forgotten, however, that there are thousands of
civil servants who are quietly doing their duty day and night. Brave people like Durga Shakti Nagpal

	7.3.5 Ethics in Politics
</h1>
<p>

“Nations are born in the hearts of poets, they prosper and die in the hands of
politicians”. ——Muhammad Iqbal
</p>

 <p>
	The word ‘politics’ comes from the Greek Word ‘polis’ which means the community or the
 state. Ancient Greek political thinkers like Plato and Aristotle describe their concept of an ideal state
 and the means to achieve it. They defined Politics as the branch which deals with the various measures
 Which should be implemented for the establishment of an ideal state. It follows, then, that politicians
 should be men and women of integrity, Vision, incorruptibility and propriety.
</p>

<h1>
	 7.3.5.1
</h1>
<p>

 Mahatma Gandhi suggested that politics should be a branch of ethics. He was, himself, a
 man of the highest standards of probity and simplicity and did not ever deviate from his conviction that
‘the end does not justify the means’. His unflinching belief and practice of satya and ahimsa in the

freedom struggle are a source of awe and inspiration for people even today.
</p>

<p>
	At the time of Independence the general expectation was that politicians would work
ceaselessly and selflessly for the sake of the country. But, unfortunately, this did not happen. Today
 politics has become a cesspool of corruption, criminalization and sloth. Politicians are perceived as
 being arrogant, callous, deceitful and untrustworthy people whose sole objective is to loot the coffers of
 the land in order to amass unlimited personal wealth. There are countless jokes about
 politicians.

“Politicians are the same all over. They promise to build bridges even when there are
no rivers.”  —— Nikita Krushchev

Citizens too have political duties that they should discharge with sincerity. They should be
vigilant and actively participate in the planning and implementation of developmental measures. They
should be vocal in expressing their approval or dissatisfaction with regard to the deeds of politicians.
They should exercise their franchise Without fail and vote only for worthy candidates.

	7.3.6 Ethics in Medicine
</h1>

<p>
	Doctor‘s have been accorded the highest status and reverence in India since times immemorial.
‘Vaidyo narayano hari’ goes the saying, an affirmation that doctors are living forms of gods. Charaka,
an ayurveda doctor who lived in the 3rd century B.C laid down principles that should be followed by
physicians. The Charaka Sastra stresses the importance of direct observation and avers that successful
medical treatment depends on four factors—the physician, substances i.e medicines and diet, the nurse
and the patient. The physician and nurse, besides possessing theoretical knowledge, must have ample

	experience and scrupulously follow hygiene. Patients are required to explain symptoms with clarity and
 diligently follow the instructions of the physician.
</p>

<h1>
	7.3.6.1 Hippocrates (460-37OB.C)
</h1>

<p>
	Hippocrates (460-37OB.C)  was an ancient Greek physician and is considered the father of
modern medicine. He emphasized the clinical study of disease and laid down the Hippocratic Oath, a
set of principles that doctors should follow. Even today a modified form of the oath is taken by physicians
of several countries. The Hippocratic Oath begins with the invocation of Apollo and Panacea, the god and goddess of Universal healing. Important duties of physicians include:

1. Treating patients to the best of one’s ability and judgement and offering the best standards
of treatment

2. Refraining from causing harm to the patient

3. Refraining from performing or aiding abortion and euthanasia(mercy killing)

4. Refraining from any form of corruption or impropriety with patients, particularly women

5. Maintaining confidentiality about the problems and diseases of patients

6. Placing the interest of the patient above one’s own interest

7. Leaving surgeries and specialized care to those who are trained in those fields

</p>


<p>
	While the basic code is still revered, abortion is legal today in many countries, particularly
under certain circumstances, and euthanasia too is slowly gaining acceptance worldwide. It is legal in
countries like Netherlands and Belgium. In India Passive Euthanasia, involving the withdrawal of life-support in certain circumstances, was made legal in 2011. It was on the basis of this landmark
judgement that Aruna Shanbaug, a nurse who had been languishing in a vegetative state for 37 years
 after being Violently attacked and molested, was finally released from her suffering.
</p>

<h1>
	7.3.6.2
</h1>
<p>

Unfortunately, as in other spheres of life, commercialization has become rampant even in
medicine. Many doctors today charge exorbitant fees, prescribe unnecessary tests or refer patients to
several specialists and ‘super specialists’ even for simple ailments. They are no longer motivated by a
desire to serve the sick or needy but, instead, are more preoccupied with making money. Some reasons


</p>

<p>
	for this attitudinal change are the hefty capitation fees that students have to pay for a seat in medicine,
the increasing incidence of legal suits being filed by patients and the pressure exerted by corporate
hospitals on its doctors to use any means whatsoever in order to improve the bottom line. Besides, it is
difficult to resist the allure of expensive gifts and exotic holidays dangled by medical companies before
the doctor for prescribing, whether needed or not, medicines of that particular company. These unethical practices should be curbed.
</p>
<p>

 ‘The Physician’s Prayer’ (1953) composed by Dr Robert Hutchinson, a renowned Scottish
 doctor, aptly captures the insensitivity and materialism that pervades medicine— “From inability to
leave well alone... ...for putting knowledge before wisdom, science before art....from treating
patients as cases and for making the cure for the disease more grievous than the endurance of
the same, good Lord deliver us.”
</p>
<p>

 To conclude, a conscientious doctor realizes that “Patients don’t care how much you know
before they know how much you care”.

	7.3.7 Ethics in Law Enforcement or Policing
</h1>

<p>
	“When you go home/ Tell them of us / And say/ For your tomorrow/ We gave our today” -
inscription at the Kohima memorial
</p>
<p>

The core functions of the police include enforcing the law, maintaining peace and protecting the

life, property and rights of all citizens. The Ministry of Home Affairs, India, laid down a model code of
conduct for the police in 1985. Accordingly, the police are expected to observe the following guiding
principles while discharging their duties:

1. Affirm allegiance to the Constitution of India and respect the rights of all citizens.
2. Be ready to lay down life in the line of duty.

3. Enforce all laws without questioning their propriety or need.

4. Enforce the law strictly without fear or favour, malice or vindictiveness.

5. Use discretion in the use of force. Force should be resorted to only when persuasion, advice
and warnings fail. The force used should be commensurate with the situation.

6. Function within their limits and not usurp the powers of the judiciary by meting out punishment
to the guilty.

7. Strive to prevent crime in the first place, rather than solve it.

8. Remember that they (the police) too are members of the public.

9. Earn the confidence and respect of the members of the public, without whose co-operation
it would be difficult to discharge the various duties.

</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page00096">96</pagenum>

</h1>
<p>

10. Be sympathetic and responsive to all members of the public, both rich and poor. Be particularly considerate to the underprivileged and to women.

11 . Be courteous and pleasant in dealings with the public.

12. Be irreproachable in private life by maintaining high standards of honesty and integrity.

13. Be always in a state of preparedness for action by constant training.

14. Rise above personal prejudices and promote a spirit of harmony and brotherhood which
 cuts across differences in caste, creed and religion.
</p>

<h1>
	7.3.7.1
</h1>
<p>
	Corruption in the police force is a major concern today. It is a specific form of misconduct
aimed at extracting financial benefits or favours in exchange for not pursuing or selectively pursuing the investigation of a crime or offence. Thus, police may receive regular ‘hafta’ or periodic ‘protection
payment’ to turn a blind eye towards a drug racket or prostitution ring. Street side hawkers and

shopkeepers doing legitimate business may be forced to part with money to avoid harassment and filing
of false charges. The police in India are notorious for being reluctant to register FIRs (First Information
Report) even when serious crimes are reported. Hapless complainants are made to run from pillar to
post on flimsy pretexts. So much so that many people prefer not to lodge a complaint for less serious
crimes than step into a police station.
</p>
<p>

It is essential to identify and remove the black sheep in the police force. It is also imperative
that the police force is given a measure of autonomy and is freed from the influence of the rich and
politically influential sections of society. Only then can it function efficiently.
</p>

<h1>
	7.3.8 Ethics in the Judiciary and Legal Services
</h1>

<p>
	 The judiciary is the branch of the government which interprets law and applies it to the facts of
 cases which deal mostly with civil disputes, crimes and family disputes. Civil law deals with disputes
 between individuals, organizations or between the two, such as property disputes. Family law deals with cases filed by close members of the family against each other, such as divorce cases. Criminal law
deals with crime and the legal punishment of criminal offences like robbery and murder. Cases are
argued by advocates, also called lawyers, of both the parties in the court and the resolution of the cases
takes place by the pronouncement of the verdict by the judge.
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page00097">97</pagenum>

<h1>
	7.3.8.1 ,page no : 97
</h1>
<p>

The Advocates Act, 1961 lays down rules on the professional and ethical standards that an
advocate should observe, some of which are:

1. The dignity of the court should be maintained under all circumstances.

2. He should not communicate with the judge in private or use influence or coercion.

3. He should not do anything illegal while dealing with the opposite party.

4. He should refuse to represent clients who insist on unfair or improper means.

5. The reputation of the opposite party should not be damaged on false grounds.

6. If the judge is a close relative, the advocate should not plead the case.

7. The advocate should not appear in any case where there is a conflict of interest. He
should not represent establishments of which he is a member.

8. He should not stand surety for the client.

9. He should not appear in a case where he himself is a witness.

10. He should uphold the interest of the client irrespective of his personal opinions.

11. He should not represent the opposite party or strike a deal with them for his personal
benefit.

12. He should not suppress material evidence.

13. He should not refuse a brief except if there is a conflict of interest. Even the most depraved
criminals have the right to be defended in Court.

14. His fees should not be based on the success of the case or taken as a percentage of the
amount or property received by the client in the event of winning the case.

15. He should not advertise or solicit work.
</p>


<h1>
	7.3.8.2
</h1>

<p>
	The general code of ethics for advocates of different countries may by and large be similar,
but there are significant differences too. Thus, while in India advocates cannot charge fees as a percentage  of amount received by the client, in the USA they can do so. In fact, in the USA there is a certain class
of advocates derisively referred to as “ambulance chasers.” These advocates rush to places where a
calamity, such as an air crash, has occurred and actively seek victims or their families on whose behalf
they can sue the organization or agency deemed responsible for the occurrence of the calamity for
astronomical amounts and then, if successful, take a huge chunk of the compensation given.
‘Ambulance chasing’ is actually illegal even in the USA but commonly takes place.

passing resolutions against appearing for certain accused people on some pretext. For instance, after a  clash between lawyers and policemen in Coimbatore in 2007, the Bar Council of Coimbatore passed
 a resolution that no lawyer would represent the policemen. Supreme Court Judge, Markandeya Katju,
 condemned the resolution stating that even suspected terrorists and mass murderers had the right to be defended in Court and refusal by a lawyer to accept a brief is “against all norms of the constitution, the
statute and professional ethics.” Such resolutions, he pointed out, are null and void and violate the
tenets of democracy. He cited, in this context, the example of Clarence Darrow(1857-1930) who
believed strongly that even those accused of heinous crimes, no matter how evil or repulsive, had the
right to be defended in court. Darrow was called Attorney for the Damned!
</p>

<h1>
	7.3.8.4
</h1>

<p>
	Judges are vested with duties of great responsibility and hold offices of public trust. An
 independent and fearless judiciary is essential for democracy to flourish. Some of the special qualities that a judge should possess are:
1.He should be a model of integrity and propriety.

2. He should have vast knowledge, particularly with reference to the  laws of the land.

3. He should be unprejudiced and impartial and not be influenced by his personal opinions.

4. He should not show discrimination on the grounds of caste, creed, religion, gender etc

5. He should show compassion and have abundant patience.

6. He should use discretion and insight in interpreting laws in the present day context.

7. He Should be incorruptible and fearless.

8. He should not allow unethical practices, such as adjoumments on flimsy grounds.

9. He should not have affiliations to political parties.

10. He should have the courage to pass strictures against the government, if warranted, and
show no fear or favour in dealing with cases relating to corruption or impropriety in high
places.

	7.3.9 Consumer Awareness,page no : 99
</h1>
<p>

It is not only people who are engaged in various trades and professions who must follow a
code of ethics, but consumers too. Consumers enjoy rights and they have duties too. The Consumer
Protection Act (1986) lays down the rights that all consumers of India enjoy. Consumers have the right
to be protected from the sale of goods and services which are hazardous to human life or health. The
act ﬁnds applicability in areas of health care and pharmaceuticals. Consumers have the right to information
about the details pertaining to the products, gadgets or services they may buy including details related
to quantity, quality, specifications of usage and functioning, and price. They also have the right to choose
the product that is most suitable for them, after taking into account their specific requirements and
budget. If the consumer feels dissatisfied with the product or service or feels that deception or unfair
misrepresentation of facts has taken place, he can seek redress in the consumer court. The Act applies
not only to goods bought at shops but also to the buying of plots and construction of buildings, travel
industry, financial products including insurance and other services.
</p>
<p>

The consumer also has the responsibility of making a thorough and independent study of the
goods or services being offered, ensure himself of the safety of the product and use the product in a
judicious manner. He should report any defect or damage that ensues as a consequence of using the
product. At the same time he should not make false or exaggerated claims about the deficiencies of the
product and file false charges in court.

<p>
	Adolescence is the stage between childhood and adulthood and comprises the teenage years
 from thirteen to nineteen. It is a period of rapid growth: up to 45% of skeletal growth, 15 to 25% of
 adult height and nearly 40% Of bone mass development takes place. Sexual maturation too takes place
during this period, accompanied by hormonal changes and wide swings in emotion. Adolescent growth
starts at about 10-12 years in girls and a couple Of years later in boys. It is not surprising, then, that
nutrition needs are greatest during this stage of life. Lack of proper nutrition can delay growth, affect
health and also make a person prone to chronic disease later in life.
</p>
<p>

Faulty nutritional habits during adolescence can result in irreversible changes to the body.

 Girls are particularly at risk because in several countries like India they are subjected to
 gender discrimination and receive a less nutritious diet compared to boys. Further, it is common for girls
 in India, especially in villages and those belonging to the lower strata Of society, to get married at a
 tender age and bear children even before they complete twenty years Of age. Malnutrition in these
 teenage mothers leads to higher risk of maternal mortality and complications during delivery such as
premature birth, stillbirth and low birth weight of the new born. A strong focus on improvement in
nutritional and health status of adolescent girls and boys is, therefore, essential for a healthy society.
 Adolescence is the right time to inculcate good food and exercise habits which contribute to good
health.
</p>

<p>
	Nutritious food is essential for the sustenance of life. Each type of food gives us energy which
 can be measured in calories. Adolescents need about 2000-2500 calories per day, depending on their
</p>

<p>
	weight, build, type of activities and work that they do. Boys need more calories than girls. Those doing
intensive physical work need more calories than someone who does not. We should adopt a diet which

provides all the essential nutrients in the required amounts, taking into account factors like
age, gender
and physical activity. This is called a balanced diet.
</p>

<p>
	Lower consumption of required nutrients over a period of time leads to under-nutrition and is
commonly seen in the poorer strata of somety. Severe and chronic under-nutrition is called malnutrition.
 At the same time it should be realized that excessive consumption of nutrients too is unhealthy and leads
to over-nutrition. It is a relatively new phenomenon in India and is jokingly referred to as a disease of
affluence. Teenagers coming from rich families, especially in urban areas, regularly consume ‘fast foods'
like burgers and pizzas which are overloaded with unhealthy fats. They neglect to eat healthy food do
not get adequate exercise, put on a lot of weight and become obese. Obesity in turn brings with it a host

of problems including increased risk of diseases like hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetes and
osteoporosis (thinning of bones).

	Group Activity and Discussion:
</h1>

<p>
	Form groups of five or six students and read the following:

. Venkataramana lives in a village and sets out early every morning to work in the
fields along with his father. In the afternoon he walks four km and attends college
in a nearby town and returns by bus. He does not have breakfast, except for a cup
of tea. For lunch he has a big bowl of rice with vegetable curry, sambhar and
buttermilk. He has idlis or dosas at night.

. Chanti is a student in a residential college in Nellore. As he is preparing hard for a
seat in engineering, he spends most of his time studying. He has no time for games. He
is fond of fried food and regularly eats samosas, bajjis and pakodas at the canteen.

During the week-end visits to his home, he orders pizzas, potato fries and large bottles
of cola.

. Lalitha is a teenager who is very fond of films. She wants to be as slim as her
favourite actress, Priya. She has decided to go on a liquid diet for a month to lose
weight quickly. She plans to drink coconut water, lemon juice and orange juice and
eat a few slices of cucumber if she feels very hungry. She also plans to do vigorous
exercise, such as swimming, cycling and running for three hours a day.
</p>

<h1>
	 8.2 ESSENTIAL NUTRIENTS IN A BALANCED DIET,page no : 102
</h1>
<p>

Nutrients can be classified as Macronutrients and Micronutrients. Macronutrients are
needed in large amounts while micronutrients are needed in small amounts. The main macronutrients
include carbohydrates, fats and proteins while vitamins and minerals constitute micronutrients. Proper
health can be maintained only if all the nutrients are absorbed by the body in adequate amounts. It is
important that calorie intake should be such that 50-60% of the total calorie intake is contributed by
carbohydrates, 20% by proteins and 15-20% from fat.
</p>
<p>

Surveys conducted by the National Nutrition Monitoring Bureau indicate that the daily intake
 of all foods except cereals and millets in Indian households is lower than the Recommended Dietary
Allowance (RDA). The average intake of pulses and legumes like green gram, Bengal gram and black
gram which are rich sources of protein was less than half the required amount. Similarly, consumption of
green leafy vegetables and other vegetables, which are rich in vitamins and minerals, was much below
the needed levels. Intake of visible fats Was also less than 50% of the RDA.

</p>
<p>

VITAMINS: A, B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12, C, D, E, K
</p>
<p>
	 MINERALS:
 MACRO MINERALS: Calcium, Magnesium, Potassium, Sodium, Phosphorous
 MICRO MINERALS: Iron, Iodine, Zinc, Selenium, Chromium, Copper, Manganese, Cobalt, Fluorine etc.
</p>

<h1>
	8.2.1 Macronutrients
8.2.1.1  Carbohydrates
</h1>

<p>
	Carbohydrates are the major source of energy. They provide more than 60% of the
 energy needed by the body. They can be classified into two types, simple and complex. Simple
carbohydrates consist of one or two simple sugars. They provide us with instant energy but offer
no nutrition and so should be consumed in small quantities. Foods high in simple carbohydrates
 include soft drinks, corn syrup and refined products such as white sugar and white flour. Complex
 carbohydrates consist of three or more sugars. These sugars are rich in vitamins and minerals.
They take a longer time to be digested and do not lead to a sudden spike in blood sugar. They
include the starches in cereals (rice, wheat, oats, barley), millets (ragi, bajra or jonnalu), pulses
(dhals or pappulu) and root vegetables; and glycogen in animal foods. Fibre is another complex

<p>
	carbohydrate. It is found as cellulose in vegetables and whole grains; and as gums and pectins in
vegetables, fruits and Cereals. It is not absorbed by the body but is very important,
nevertheless, as it delays absorption of carbohydrates and fats, adds bulk to the stools and increases a feeling of
satiety or “fullness”. Regular intake of fibre helps to prevent heart disease and some types of
cancer, such as colon and breast cancer. Refined and processed foods contain low amounts of
fibre and should be avoided. In India 70-80% of total dietary calories are derived from
carbohydrates present in plant foods such as cereals, pulses and millets.
</p>

<p>
	Why is brown bread preferable to white bread in terms of nutrition?
It is better to eat an apple rather than to drink apple juice. Why?

</p>

<h1>
	8.2.1.2 Proteins
</h1>


<p>
	 Proteins are necessary for building and repairing body tissue and are also a source of
	 energy.
They are made of amino acids. The amount of protein required depends on the body weight and
composition, rate of growth of the individual, physical activity level and presence of illness or injury.
Sportsmen need greater amounts of protein. Requirements are also greater during childhood and
adolescence for growth and development as also during pregnancy or when the body needs to recover
from an illness. Adolescents need 45-55 gms of protein a day.
</p>

<p>
	Animal sources such as meats, milk, fish and eggs are rich in protein. Plant proteins are found

in whole grains, pulses, legumes, nuts and seeds. Soyabean, chickpea(chole), kidneybean (rajma),

cashews, walnuts, quinoa, sunflower seeds and sesame seeds are examples of foods which contain

 proteins. Vegetarians shOuld take care to consume adequate amounts of protein in their diet as fruits are

a poor source of protein and most vegetables too contain only very small amounts of protein. Protein

supplements are available in the market and are used mostly by youngsters interested in body building.

They can also be used during recovery from an illness. Protein deficiency can lead to various ailments

including mental retardation and kwashiorkor. Symptoms of kwashiorkor include failure to grow, a
swollen belly and legs, lethargy and diarrhoea. Protein deficiency is commonly found in poor countries.
</p>

<p>
	 Certain proteins found in certain foods may cause mild or even life threatening allergic
 reaction.For example, some people are allergic to casein, the protein in milk. Others are allergic to gluten, the
 protein in wheat and other grains. Some are allergic to the proteins found in peanuts or shell fish.
</p>

<h1>
	8.2.1.3 Fats
</h1>
<p>

Fats are a source of essential fatty acids, an important dietary requirement. They may be

visible or invisible. Visible fats include cooking oils and fats such as butter, ghee and vanaspathi while

invisible fats are present in plant (peanut, coconut, sesame, soya bean etc) and animal foods (eggs, red meat). Fats are a rich, concentrated source of energy and so are particularly necessary in adequate

 quantities for children. They are broken down in the body to release glycerol and fatty acids. The

glycerol is converted to glucose by the liver and is a source of energy. Fats also serve as a vehicle for

 the absorption and transportation of vitamins A, D, E and K, all of which are fat soluble but not water

 soluble. Fats are necessary for maintaining body temperature and for the proper functioning of cells.

 They keep the skin and hair in good condition.
</p>
<p>

Fats may be saturated or unsaturated. Both types are needed by the body. Saturated fats tend
 to solidify at room temperature and their intake Should be restricted. Unsaturated fats are liquids and
 may be mono-unsaturated or polyunsaturated. They are healthier than saturated fats. Olive oil, canola
 oil and peanut oil are examples of mono—unsaturated fats while corn oil, Safflower and sunflower oils
 are examples of polyunsaturated fats. Adults Should avoid taking large quantities of fats as it could lead
to diseases like hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Instead of always using only one
 particular type of cooking oil, different types of cooking oils should be used by rotation to get the
 advantages of the different kinds of essential fatty acids.

	8.2.2 Micronutrients,page no : 105
</h1>

<p>
	Micronutrients, though needed in very small quantities, are essential for normal growth,
metabolism and physical well-being. They can be classified into two groups— vitamins and minerals.
</p>


<h1>
	8.2.2.1 Vitamins
</h1>
<p>

Vitamins are organic nutrients. This means that like carbohydrates, proteins and fats ,they are
not made in the body and are mainly obtained through food. Insufficient intake of vitamins leads to
deficiency disorders. There are 13 known Vitamins. They include VitaminA, beta-carotene, Vitamin
B1, Vitamin B2, vitamin B6, vitamin B12 ,biotin, Vitamin C, vitamin D, Vitamin E, folic acid, vitamin K,
niacin and pantothenic acid.
</p>

<h1>
	8.2.2.2 Minerals
</h1>
<p>

Minerals include macro-elements like calcium, magnesium, potassium and sodium, needed in
relatively large quantities and micro-elements like iron, iodine, zinc, selenium, chromium, cobalt
and manganese.

	 8.3 GUIDELINES FOR GOOD FOOD HABITS,page no : 106
</h1>
<p>

. A varied diet is necessary. No single food contains all the nutrients we need. A diet which is
low in fat, moderately high in carbohydrates and rich in protein is ideal for adolescents.

. A variety of grains and pulses should be consumed. A diet containing whole grains, pulses,
vegetables, fruits and milk can prevent most deficiency diseases.

. Fresh vegetables and fruits should be consumed in plenty as they are rich in nutrients like
 beta-carotene, folate, calcium, riboflavin and iron. About 300gms of vegetables, including 50
 gm of green leafy vegetables should be consumed daily. About 1OOgm of fruit should be eaten
 daily. Vegetables and fruits of all colours should be eaten regularly as each type contains different types and amounts of micronutrients.

. A wide variety of vegetables and fruits should be eaten for maximising nutrient benefits of
different foods. Fresh amla, guava, banana, certain vegetables such as turnips, citrus fruits like
orange and lime, are rich in vitamin C. Tomatoes and water melon are a good source of lycopene,
a natural chemical that prevents heart disease and some kinds of cancer. Cruciferous vegetables

</h1>

<p>
	like cabbage, cauliflower and radish contain large amounts of Vitamin A, vitamin C, fibre and
manganese. Berries including blueberries, strawberries and raspberries are rich in antioxidants
and help in preventing several diseases. Bananas are rich in potassium while apples are rich in
pectin, an insoluble fibre.

. Foods of animal origin such as milk, eggs and meat should be included in the diet. Vegetarians
are prone to protein and vitamin B12 deficiency and should consume more pulses and lentils,
milk and curds and also take B 12 supplements, 1f needed.

. Foods which are rich in iron should be eaten. Green leafy vegetables, whole grains an
nuts are rich in iron and should be eaten by teenagers, particularly girls. Iron deficiency is the
most prevalent health problem in the world affecting the health of millions of women and leading
to high rates of maternal mortality.

. Fried foods should be consumed in moderation. They increase the risk of obesity, stroke,
heart disease, diabetes and also various kinds of cancers. Different types of cooking oils should
be used by rotation such as sunflower oil, safflower oil, groundnut oil and rice bran oil.

. Processed foods should be avoided. They contain additives like chemical preservatives,
colour, excessive salt and sugar. It is better to drink fresh home-made soup and fruit juice
rather than buy a can or bottle of the product at a store.

. The intake of sugar should be restricted. The amount of sugar per day should not exceed
90gms and this includes the sugars that are found naturally in fruits, vegetables and dairy products.
One medium carrot, for example, contains 5gms of sugar while a large apple contains more
than 20 gms. Added sugar should be kept to the minimum as it is absorbed in a different way by
 the body when compared to natural sugars. Excessive sugar, as in bakery products like cakes
and pastries and drinks like colas and artificial fruit juices contribute to tooth decay, obesity,
lowered immunity, kidney damage, hyperactivity and depression, besides leading to mineral
deficiencies. Jaggery is rich in calcium, iron and potassium and can be used as a healthy
substitute for sugar where possible. Artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and sucralose
contain less calories than sugar but some studies have shown that they may be harmful and
could cause serious health problems if taken regularly.

. Salt intake should be restricted to less than 6gms a day. Most Indians consume more, often
without realizing it. Salt consists of 40% sodium and 60% chloride. It is the sodium that is
harmful in excess. Not many know that even a slice of bread contains as much as 100-200mg
of sodium. Salt is a preservative and the sodium content in pickles and in processed and
canned food, such as tomato ketchup and biscuits is very high. Excessive salt intake increases
the risk of hypertension, osteoporosis, kidney disease and certain kinds of cancers. It has been
commonly observed that consumption of salty, fried food, such as potato chips and intake of
sugar sweetened drinks often go hand in hand among adolescents.

</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000108">108</pagenum>

<p>

.  It is essential to drink 3-4 litres of water every day. Water helps to flush out toxins and
waste products from the system, maintains body temperature, carries nutrients to cells and aids
digestion.

. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day and should not be skipped. Typical Indian
breakfast dishes like dosa, upma, idli and paratha are nutritious as they contain a variety of
 grains, pulses and lentils and sometimes vegetables too. Sprouts are a wonderful and inexpen-
sive source of nutrients like proteins, vitamins and fibre and should be incorporated into the diet
on a regular basis. The trend of eating readymade cereals is catching on in India but it must be
kept in mind that most of the cereals sold in the supermarket contain large amounts of added
sugar, salt and preservatives and are low in fibre.

. It is preferable to eat a number of small meals rather than two or three heavy ones.

. Meals should be had at regular timings. Avoid over-eating, binge eating (eating large quan-
tities in a short time) or prolonged fasting. Crash diets (severe restriction of food in order to lose
weight in a short time) and mono diets (eating only one particular food for all meals for a few
days e.g. eating only apples for three or four days) should be avoided. Avoid Snacking on
energy-dense but nutrient-poor foods like chips, pastries, biscuits and high—fat ice-cream.

. Eat in a peaceful environment leisurely as the body absorbs nutrition best when there is
minimum stress. Avoid watching TV while eating and, instead, relish the food.

<h1>

8.4 Exercise

</h1>

<p>
	 A nutritious diet alone is not enough for good health. Exercise too plays a vital role in maintaining
health. Regular physical activity prevents various diseases and contributes to well-being. It is important
 to incorporate exercise into the daily routine from a young age as habits learnt in childhood often

continue to be incorporated into one’s lifestyle as adults. In earlier days children walked long distances

to school and those living in villages helped in the cultivation and harvesting of crops as well as tending

animals. There was, thus, no particular need for sports. But urbanization and migration to cities have

 changed the social milieu considerably. Children in towns go by bus or car to school and there is hardly

any scope for exercise in the day to day activities. It is important, therefore, to have sports at schools
and colleges. Cricket, football, tennis, badminton and swimming are some popular sports which teens

 enjoy. There are gyms too in most towns, which offer a wide range of exercises on different machines.

There are places today which teach aerobic exercises with music and dance. Zumba, a dance fitness

programme, combines salsa, tango, hip hop, mambo and martial arts. However, even without sports

 facilities and gyms, one can get physical exercise easily. Brisk walking, jogging, skipping rope, cycling,

kabaddi and playing cricket or football in open spaces are fun ways of keeping fit. Yoga and pranayam
can be incorporated into one’s routine.
</p>

<p>
	Vigorous exercise for at least 45 minutes on five days of the week is recommended by most
doctors. Exercise increases muscle and bone strength and burns excess fat. Cycling for an hour leisurely,

</p>







<pagenum page="normal" id="page000109">109</pagenum>

</h1>

<p>
	for instance, burns over 200 calories, while batting or bowling in cricket burn about 300
calories.
Exercise helps to maintain the ideal weight and prevents obesity. It also has psychological benefits  as
it improves mood and reduces depression. Outdoor activity in the sun increases the intake of vitamin
D, considered today as a ‘miracle’ vitamin because of its several different benefits to health. Simple
changes can be incorporated to get more exercise, such as using the stairs instead of the lift, walking to
the grocery store instead of using the bus or car, helping in household chores like sweeping and washing
clothes. Further, it is important to get 8 hours of sleep every night. It is during sleep that the body
repairs itself and get rest. One feels refreshed and active after a good night’s sleep. Prolonged sleep
deprivation can result in poor concentration, irritability and a weakened immune system. Phones should
be switched off so that there is no disturbance.

	. Ajay is a student of 1st year Intermediate. His doctor recently told him that he was overweight by 5 kg
	and recommended a diet with less fat and more protein. He also insisted that Ajay needed to do some
vigorous exercise every day. Ajay's father is of the opinion that the dieting and exercise can wait till
Ajay gets a seat in medicine and that, meanwhile, he should spend every minute on studies. Ajay's
grandmother openly declares that the doctor knows nothing. She says that in their youth they ate ghee,
pickles and papads every day and also frequently had dishes like pulihora, vada, bobbatlu and
payasam. Yet they were all quite healthy. So why should the poor child be made to starve? Ajay's mother
is helpless in the matter of diet as she does not have the courage to defy her mother-in-law. She,
however, shouts at Ajay to go for a run on the road for at least 15 minutes a day. Ajay refuses, saying that
dogs will chase him. He says he is willing to play tennis but he should first be given a good racquet,

8.5 COMMUNICABLE DISEASES
</h1>

<p>
	 Diseases may be classified as communicable and non-communicable. Communicable diseases
are those that spread from person to person through pathogens i.e. disease causing organisms such as
virus, bacteria, fungus and protozoa. Common communicable diseases in India caused by virus include
chickenpox, measles, flu, chikungunya, dengue fever, viral hepatitis and pneumonia. Typhoid, leprosy
and cholera are examples of diseases caused by bacteria. Ringworm and athlete’s foot are spread by
fungi while malaria is caused by protozoa. Non-communicable diseases (NCDS) are not caused by
pathogens and do not spread from person to person. Asthma, chronic kidney disease and stroke are
some non communicable diseases that are caused by the improper functioning of some organ or system
in the body. Some of these conditions or defects may be present from birth, such as autism and
congenital heartdisease. Some NCDS are related to ageing, such as osteoporosis (thinning of bones)
and Parkinson’s disease while others are life-style diseases which are triggered at least in part by faulty
eating and living patterns, such as cancer, diabetes and arteriosclerosis (thickening of arteries) and are
preventable to some extent.
</p>
<h1>

8.5.1 How Communicable Diseases Spread
</h1>

<p>
	The most common ways communicable diseases spread from person to person are:

</p>
<h1>
	Transmission of germs through air:
</h1>
<p>
	Sneezing and coughing cause germs to be expelled
from the nose and these germs may be inhaled by people around. Influenza, diphtheria and whooping
cough spread in this way. Anthrax is an example of a disease in which the microorganism remains in the
air for a long time and enters the body of a person who breathes the contaminated air. The bacteria
forms dormant Spores which may remain suspended in the environment for decades and even centuries.

</p>
<h1>
	Contaminated food and water:
</h1>
<p>
	Diseases like cholera, dysentery, typhoid and infective
hepatitis spread through the contamination of food and water. Food that is undercooked or spoilt is a
 fertile breeding ground for germs. Sometimes sewage water gets mixed with drinking water.

</p>




<pagenum page="normal" id="page000111">111</pagenum>


<h1>
	Direct or Indirect contact with the infected person:,page no : 111
</h1>
<p>
	Diseases like T.B. spread among close
members of the family who have prolonged contact with the infected person. Sharing of utensils and
bedclothes increase chances of the spread of the disease. Diseases like HIV spread through sexual contact
with an infected person as well as through sharing of syringes and transfusion of blood from an infected
person.
</p>
<h1>
	Bites from insects and animals:
</h1>
<p>
	Malaria, dengue and chikungunya are spread by the bite
of mosquitoes which harbour the parasites. Plague is a disease spread by rats. The plague epidemic in Surat in 1994 lasted nearly two months and over 700 cases were reported. More than 3 lakh panic
stricken inhabitants left the city in just two days. Rabies is caused by the bite of an infected animal such
as a dog or a monkey.
</p>

<h1>
	8.5.2 Precautions to Prevent Spread of Communicable Diseases
</h1>

<p>

	Many communicable diseases can be prevented to a large extent by following simple precautions
based on common sense. Some of them are:
</p>

<h1>
	a) Wash hands frequently:
</h1>
<p>
	This single step can give substantial protection against infectious
diseases. Studies have shown that during epidemics of swine flu the single most effective precau-
tion one could take was to wash one’s hands frequently.
</p>

<h1>

b) Handle and prepare food safely:
</h1>
<p>
	Food should be prepared and served in a hygienic manner.
Vegetables and fruits should be washed thoroughly before being cut. Frozen food, especially
meat, should be thawed properly and stale, decaying food should be discarded. Food should
not be left out in the open for long but should be refrigerated. Sterilized clothes, caps and
gloves should be always used by workers who prepare and serve food on a large scale.
Sometimes a person may be a silent carrier of a disease, without personally suffering any
symptoms. “Typhoid Mary" (1869-1938), a silent carrier of typhus germs, infected nearly 50

persons in the U.S during her career as a cook. 3 of her ‘victims’ died of the disease.
</p>


<h1>
	c) Keep the house and ofﬁce clean:
</h1>
<p>
Studies have shown that the vegetable cutting board and the
office computer may contain more germs than the toilet seat! Houses and work places should be
kept clean and free of cockroaches, mosquitoes, flies, rats and bugs. The kitchen and bathrooms,
in particular, should be disinfected regularly. Bed linen and curtains should be changed often.
Carpets and rugs harbour millions of dust mites and should be cleaned periodically. Laptops,
mobile phones and TV remotes may be handled by several people and these too should be
wiped regularly with a mild disinfectant. Houses should be mosquito proofed, if possible.
</p>





<pagenum page="normal" id="page000112">112</pagenum>

<h1>
d) 	Do not let water stagnate:,page no : 112
</h1>
<p>
	Stagnate water become a breeding place for mosquitoes. Room
coolers should be dried when summer is over. Discarded tyres, broken mugs and buckets,
coconut shells etc should be thrown away as water may accumulate in them.

</p>
<h1>
e) Do not share personal items:
</h1>
<p>
	Personal articles like toothbrushes, combs, towels and razors
should not be shared. Needles for injecting medicines should be used only once and destroyed.
</p>
<h1>
 f)	Cover your mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing:
</h1>
<p>
	This is another simple step
which can prevent transmission of germs.
</p>

<h1>
 g)	Remain home when sick:
</h1>
<p>
	One should remain confined to the house for some days if suffering
from diseases like chicken pox or typhoid and should stay a reasonable distance away from
others if suffering from influenza.
</p>

<h1>
h)	Drink purified water and eat in hygienic places:
</h1>
<p>
	Water should be boiled or purified in order
to kill germs. One should be careful while drinking water or eating food like bajjis and chaat
during the rainy season at wayside bandis and dhabas, more so if the food is cold, as germs
spread rapidly in a damp or wet environment.
</p>

<h1>
 i)	Do not spit or urinate in public spaces:
</h1>
<p>
	In India it is common to find people urinating and
spitting in public. Diseases like diarrhoea and T.B spread rapidly in such unhygienic conditions.
It is estimated that half of India’s population does not have access to a lavatory and people are
compelled to defecate in the open. A major reason for the high dropout rate of girls in schools
in India is the lack of toilets. The Poo2Loo campaign supported by UNICEF was started in
India in January 2014 to bring awareness about the health hazards of defecating in the open.
</p>

<h1>
	j) Dispose of garbage carefully:
</h1>
<p>
	Garbage and kitchen waste should not be thrown out in the
open but should be disposed of in a hygienic manner. Open garbage is a breeding ground for
flies, mosquitoes and other pests. Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, a national level campaign which
Was officially launched on Gandhi Jayanti, 2014 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi aims to
accomplish the vision of ‘Clean India’ by 2nd October 2019, the 150th birthday of Gandhiji.

</p>

<h1>
 k)	Take proper care of pets:
</h1>
<p>
	Pets should be kept clean and should be regularly vaccinated against
rabies and other diseases. Do not touch wild animals as they may be rabid.
</p>

<h1>
l) Take all required vaccines:
</h1>
<p>
	Several communicable diseases can be prevented by taking vaccines
which lend immunity against the particular disease. In India vaccines are routinely administered

 diseases like smallpox have been eradicated from the world, largely through vaccination. Polio
too has almost been eradicated. Vaccines are available for the prevention of T.B, cholera,
typhoid, chicken pox, tetanus and several other diseases such as yellow fever, meningitis and
hepatitis B.

 m)	Safe Sex practices:
</h1>

	HIV/ AIDS, syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea are examples of diseases
which are transmitted through unsafe sex. It is better to be faithful to one partner rather than
have sex with multiple partners as, otherwise, chances of acquiring and spreading sexually
transmitted diseases (STDs) increase. STDs are often very painful and difficult to treat as they
tend to recur. Prostitutes and drug addicts are high risk groups for STDs.

	8.6 Risk Behaviour
</h1>
<p>

Adolescence is commonly referred to as the ‘troubled teens’. Teenagers sometimes display
poor self-control, judgement and decision making. They are impulsive and prone to risk taking behaviour.

Risk taking behaviour is manifested in a variety of ways such as alcohol and substance abuse, rash
driving, street racing, unsafe sexual activity and aggressive and violent activities including crime. There
may be a number of factors which contribute to risky and reckless behaviour among teens. These

include:
</p>
<h1>

. Incomplete development of the brain:
</h1>
<p>
	The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain which is
responsible for problem solving and decision making, is not fully developed during adoles-
cence. The amygdala, the part of the brain that is responsible for impulsive and emotional
behaviour, is more active at this time. Teenagers may not be able to fully comprehend, thus, the
implications and long term consequences of drunken driving or experimental sex.
</p>

<h1>
	. Spurt in hormones:
</h1>
<p>
	Many hormones are secreted during adolescence, such as adrenal stress
hormones, growth hormones and sex hormones such as testosterone, oestrogen and pro geSter- '
one..These hormones inﬂuence mood and behaviour. A small argument can flare up into an ugly

 incident of stabbing.
</p>

<h1>
	Peer pressure:
</h1>
Peer pressure and approval greatly influence teen behaviour. For instance a
teenager may drink alcohol or take drugs as others in his group do so and he does not wish to
be seen as being ‘different’ or be made fun of. It has been observed that teens indulge in more
risk taking in the company of their peers.


<h1>
	. Assertion of individuality:
</h1>
<p>
	Adolescence is a time when youngsters wish to assert themselves
by an open defiance of authority. It is thrilling to do something that is prohibited and to test the
limits of one’s skills or endurance. For example a teenager may find it challenging and exciting

to try death defying stunts on his bike on a highway in the dead of the night, egged on and

<p>

cheered by his friends. At a beach he may venture into the sea though there is a board prohib-

iting swimming in that area because of dangerous currents. The more the restrictions, the greater
the thrill!

</p>
<h1>
	8.6.1 Avoidance of Risk Behaviour
</h1>
<p>

While it is unrealistic to expect that risk behaviour among adolescents can be completely

eliminated, it is possible to curb it by adopting the following measures:
</p>

<h1>
	Support of Parents and Teachers
</h1>
<p>

a) The teen receives love and support from the parents and other family members.

b) The teen feels free to talk to his parents and share his innermost thoughts, wishes and fears.

c) The teen has access to other adults with whom he can discuss his problems.

d) Parents play an active role in the teen’s academic and extra-curricular activities.

e) The school/college is a place where the teen feels at ease and can seek the advice of teachers.
</p>

<h1>
	 Boundaries Laid Down By Parents
</h1>

<p>
	a) Parents lay down standards for appropriate behaviour.

b) Parents discipline the child when rules are broken.

c) Parents are aware of the movements of the teen and the company he keeps.

d) Parents ensure that the number of outings and the time spent does not cross a reasonable limit.

e) Parents have an idea about the activities of the teen on the internet.
</p>

<h1>
	Structured Time Use
</h1>

<p>

a) The teenager should be actively encouraged to pursue a hobby such as music or painting.

b) The teen should participate in a sport like cricket or football at least thrice a week.

c) Interesting home assignments should be given at school to keep the teen occupied produc-
tively.

d) The teen can take up some part time course to improve his skills. It could be an online course.

e) The teen should be encouraged to take up some community or social work with friends, say

volunteering to teach slum children twice a week or participating in a door to door campaign
about creating awareness about proper garbage disposal.

</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000115">115</pagenum>

<h1>
	Development of Core Values and Self Esteem in the Teenager,page no : 115
</h1>
<p>

a) The teenager should be encouraged to build a set of core values.

b) The teenager should be educated by parents and teachers about the hazards and consequences
of risk taking behaviour. A frank but sensitive approach is needed so that the teen feels free to
discuss her doubts and fears.

c) The teen should be encouraged to develop self esteem so that she does not succumb to peer by
pressure and is not afraid of being called a sissy or Spoilsport by her group.
</p>

<h1>
	8.7 SUBSTANCE ABUSE (ALCOHOL, NICOTINE, DRUGS)
</h1>
<p>

Substance abuse or drug abuse is a disorder characterized by the deliberate use of a substance
for a non-medical purpose, which causes significant physiological harm. Such substances include nicotine
(in cigarettes), alcohol and illegal recreational drugs like marijuana (bhang, charas, hashish), Ecstacy
and LSD. They also include some prescription medicines such as stimulants like amphetamines,
 anaesthetics like phencyclidine, opiates like codeine and sedatives like barbiturates. Yet others may be
commonly used household articles like paint thinners, aerosol sprays and nail polish removers. Some of
these sUbstances are snorted, while others are drunk, smoked, swallowed, chewed, inhaled, injected

or even eaten (as in the form of methamphetamine coated chocolates which are legally available in
some places, such as Colorado, U. S. A).
</p>

<p>

A national survey conducted a few years ago in collaboration with the U.N.O indicated that
that there were more than 7.5 crore drug addicts in India and that the number is growing. Teenagers
constituted a sizeable number of these addicts. It was found that while earlier a majority of drug addicts
belonged to the upper socio-economic strata, substance abuse is now becoming rampant among the
middle and poor classes too. Alcohol accounts for the maximum abuse. It was estimated that about
21% of teenagers in India consumed alcohol, 3% Were addicted to cannabis and about 1% to opiates.
</p>

<p>
	Common reasons cited for taking addictive substances were social reasons, enjoyment,
curiosity and relief from mental stress. Urbanization, migration and the breakdown of the joint family
system are some of the factors which have contributed to stress in modern life and loss of traditional
societal controls, leading in turn to dependence on drugs. Teenagers may initially take one of these
substances just for fun or because of peer pressure but very often they become addicted to it and
</p>






<pagenum page="normal" id="page000116">116</pagenum>
<h1>
	 page no : 116
</h1>

<p>
	 become aggressive and uncontrollable if deprived of their daily ‘fix’. It is common to hear of teenage
 drug addicts stealing money and jewellery from home in order to buy drugs.
</p>

<h1>
	 8.7.1 Effects of Substance Abuse
</h1>
<p>

Substance abuse can cause neurological, respiratory and cardio-vascular damage, depending
 on the type of drug, dosage, frequency and individual factors. It can also lead to frightening psychological
effects like hallucinations (perceiving something that does not exist -e.g. a person believes he is floating
on clouds or that snakes are crawling all over him) and paranoia (delusion of persecution or aggravated
 self-importance eg a person is convinced on hearing the door-bell that soldiers from an enemy country
are out to get him or he believes that he is a popular film star). Initially a small dose of the substance is
enough to give a ‘high’ or feeling of euphoria but later increasingly large amounts of the substance may
be needed to experience the same intensity of sensation or experience. Often multiple drugs are combined
 and used with alcohol. This is far more dangerous than taking a single drug. Sudden stopping of the

 abused substance gives rise to withdrawal symptoms which may be unbearable, such as tremors,
 severe depression, seizures and in extreme cases, even death.
</p>

<p>
	Risk behaviour increases when drugs are taken and may result in fatal injuries. It is common,
for example, for accidents to take place when people drive under the influence of alcohol or cannabis
as reflexes and concentration are affected. Drug addicts from poorer strata regularly share needles to
 inject drugs and, thereby, expose themselves to the risk of various diseases like HIV. Studies have
shown a strong correlation between substance abuse and promiscuous behaviour. Drug addicts may
 have several sexual partners and this increases the likelihood of contracting STDs. It is not just the
 individual but the family and also society that are impacted by substance abuse. Poor academic and
work performance, dropping out of school or college, inability to hold a job, stress in relationships and

break up of marriage, inability to meet family or societal obligations these are just a few of the
 effects of drug abuse.
</p>

<p>

Ironically, many Western rock stars and actors in the entertainment industry or ‘ show-biz’

 openly acknowledge taking heavy doses of recreational drugs and sedatives. Michael Jackson, Jim

Morrison, Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe are some of the iconic legends whose death was caused

or precipitated by drug overdose. In the field of sports too, it is common for men and women throughout

the world to take anabolic steroids, a category of banned drugs, to enhance performance. Michael

 Phelps (swimming), Andre Agassi (tennis) and Maradona (soccer) are just three examples of famous

sportsmen who confessed to having taken drugs. Marion Jones, the first female American millionaire

sportswoman, had to forfeit all 5 medals she won in the 2000 Olympics after admitting that she had
taken drugs.
</p>

<h1>
	8.7.2 Prevention of Substance Abuse among Teens
</h1>
<p>

The earlier a person indulges in substance abuse the greater is the chance of becoming an
addict. It is important, therefore, to prevent substance abuse from childhood itself. Substance abuse

</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000117">117</pagenum>
<h1>
	 page no : 117
</h1>
<p>
	prevention generally focuses on alcohol, tobacco and marijuana based on the ‘Gateway Drug Theory’
which proposes that these three substances are generally used first and may lead finally to the use of
hard drugs like cocaine and heroin. Prevention is effected at three levels——primary, secondary and
tertiary. At the primary level the aim is to reduce incidence, at the secondary level the aim is to reduce
prevalence while at the tertiary level the focus is on treatment and rehabilitation.
</p>
<p>

The family, school, community and neighbourhood can play a crucial role in inculcating good
values in adolescents and ensuring that teens are sensitised to the dangers of substance abuse. The
individual should develop enough self-worth and self-confidence to be able to refuse drugs even if
pressurised by friends. Apart from the family, school and the community, the government too can play
a vital role in the prevention of substance abuse. Legislation is an effective tool which can be used by the
government to curb the growth and sale of narcotic substances and other drugs. In recent years the
government of India has prohibited advertisements relating to liquor and cigarettes on TV and has also
prohibited the glorification of such substances in movies. It is now an offence to smoke in public places.

NGOs too play a Supportive role. They conduct campaigns highlighting the dangers of substance abuse
and also run counselling centres and de—addiction centres.

9.1 Modern Technological Devices and Impact on Youth
</h1>
<p>

 Technology is constantly changing the world in which we live. It alters the way we work,
 dress, travel, relax, cook, play, interact and even the way we think. Applications of modern technology
are countless in number and include devices and gadgets like the telephone, TV, camera, Video cassette
recorder, microwave oven, computer, Internet, cell phone, iPod and the iPad. Once we get used to the
latest “marvel” of technology, it becomes almost impossible to think of life without it. This is especially
true for youngsters who are quick to adapt to new technologies.
</p>
<p>

Two modern technological inventions that have revolutionized the lives of the young generation
 are, undoubtedly, the Internet and the mobile phone. The two devices have merged and, today, it is the
rule, rather than the exception, to have a cell phone with Internet connectivity. And, if the phone has a
big screen, it ceases to be a humble instrument of communication and becomes a ‘phablet’- a mini
computer or tablet + phone! Social networking sites are also getting increasingly popular among youth.

</p>
<p>
	It is fascinating to observe how these inventions have radically altered, both for the better and
the worse, the lives of teenagers over the years. Like it or not, technology is here to stay and play an
increasingly integral role in every activity of Generation Y(those born in the 1990s and later). It is
necessary, therefore, to guide the youth in the judicious and ethical use of technology.

9.2.1  Uses of the Internet
</h1>

<p>
	Given below are some of the benefits of the Internet.
</p>

<h1>
	9.2.1.1 Availability of Vast Resources
</h1>
<p>

The information that is accessible on the Internet is practically infinite. One need not go all the
way to a library in search of information, whether in the field of sciences, humanities, fine arts or
medicine. Scholarly articles, articles for the layman, encyclopaedias, and even entire books are readily
accessible at the click of the mouse. Most of the websites can be accessed for free while some require
a nominal payment to be made. Online courses are a boon for those who cannot enroll in regular
institutions due to some constraint, such as distance, cost or lack of time.
</p>

<h1>
	9.2.1.2 Instant and Easy Access to Information
</h1>

<p>
	It is not just the amount of information available on the net that is mind boggling, but also the
speed at which it can be accessed. It takes just seconds for a website to open and, within
minutes, one
can go through several web sites in search of the information that is needed. What is an abatjour and
how is the Word pronounced? Which is the tallest building in the world and what is its height?
How can one make tasty Hyderabadi dum biryani? What are the typical symptoms of glaucoma?

term has been used.
</p>

<h1>
	9.2.1.3 Effortless Communication with Friends and Family
</h1>
<p>

Letter writing has become almost obsolete today. ‘SnailMail’ or the slow, cumbersome process
of writing, posting and delivering of letters has been replaced by instant, hassle-free ‘email’
i.e. electronic mail.
</p>
<h1>
	9.2.1.4 Easy Interaction with Unknown Persons
</h1>
<p>

Networking sites on the Internet enable us to chat not only with family members and friends
but also with unknown persons. There are several forums on the Internet for people sharing common
interests, such as those interested in Hindustani Classical Music or Renaissance Paintings or Greek
Mythology; or those interested in growing organic food or those opposed to the use of plastic etc.
There are also special ‘support groups’ , consisting of people who do not know one another but who

share a common problem and who offer encouragement and support to each other by sharing their
experiences and challenges online. Thus we have support groups for alcoholics, cancer patients and
their care givers, mothers of new-borns and so on.
</p>
<h1>
	9.2.1.5 Source of Endless Entertainment
</h1>
<p>

Do you want to see the old classic ‘Devdas’ but cannot find it in a DVD store? Are you
curious to hear Strauss’ Blue Danube or feel like listening to M.S.Subbulakshmi’s
‘BhajaGovindam’?
Missed the latest episode of your favourite TV serial? All one has to do is download them from the Internet. With the use of the Internet we can listen to music and watch movies and TV shows. Besides,
we can also play online games. These games may be action or adventure games, board games, racing
games, puzzle games, skill games and games specially suited for girls. Some are 2 player or even multi
player games. We can play chess, thus, sitting in Kavutaram, a small Village in A.P, with some unknown
person seated, say, in Durgapur, W.B, or, for that matter, even with someone playing in Helsinki,
Finland. There are computers which are specially suited for those who are fond of heavy ‘gaming’. The scope for entertainment on the Internet is practically unlimited.
</p>

<h1>
	9.2.1.6 Flexi-Work and Easy Transfer of Data

</h1>
<p>
	It is no longer necessary to follow rigid timings of work in the office. Work can be completed

or continued at home on a computer and reports, bulky data, files etc can be transmitted to any corner
of the earth in seconds. Similarly any amount of information can be downloaded from the Internet,
along with elaborate graphs, charts, tables and pictures.

<h1>
	9.2.2 Drawbacks of the Internet and Misuse among Youth
</h1>

<p>
	However, the Intemet is not without its disadvantages. Given below are some of the drawbacks,
both direct and indirect, as well as the ways it can be misused, especially by youngsters.
</p>

<h1>
	9.2.2.1 Excessive dependence on Technology and Addiction
</h1>
<p>

The Internet is not only a substitute for a library, but doubles up as a TV, a phone, a music
provider and a medium to play games and interact with friends. Youngsters, especially in western
countries, spend a lot of time on the Internet. The extent of dependence on the Internet can be
alarming at times. It may border on addiction. There are instances of teenagers Collapsing after
‘gaming’ for several hours without a break. Today the lexicon has expanded to denote different
classes of gamers—we have newbies, casual, core, hard core, pro and retrogamers, to name a
few! (OK, check up the meaning of these terms on the Internet!). Teenagers are frustrated if the
server is down even for a few seconds or if a page fails to load at once. Checking e-mail and text
messages can become a compulsive addiction.
</p>

<h1>
	9.2.2.2 Disconnect with the Real World
</h1>
<p>

Youngsters are so immersed in the virtual world that they are losing connection with the real
world in which they live. They spend hours together browsing the web, playing online games and being
active on social networking sites. Even while walking on the road, they plug their ears and listen to
music which they have downloaded and are oblivious of what is happening around them.
</p>

<h1>
	9.2.2.3 Loss of Skills
</h1>

<p>
	Youngsters, especially in advanced countries, are accustomed to using their laptop from a
tender age and, as a result, rarely have an occasion to practise handwriting. Not only
Calligraphy, even
Cursive Writing seems to be on its way out.
</p>

Many would find it difficult to look up a word in a (physical) dictionary or perform mathematical
calculations on their own because of their over-dependence on online tools. Today we need not spend
much thought while preparing charts and graphs or writing CVs and letters as the basic formats are all
available on the web.
</p>

<p>
	Our way of planning, preparing and writing a presentation or essay has changed drastically.
We need not be systematic in arranging our ideas or organizing the structure of an essay in advance as
we can type whatever comes to our mind and then shuffle sentences and paragraphs around with
utmost ease. Work is often done on a piece meal basis on the Internet and not as a coherent whole.
</p>

<h1>
	9.2.2.4 Break-down of Family Ties
</h1>
<p>

Present day adolescents spend so much time on the Internet that the time they spend with
family members is decreasing day by day. Even at dinner, the teenager is constantly checking mail or
sending messages and hardly participates in family discussions and activities.
</p>
<h1>

9.2.2.5 Inability to Communicate in the Real Social World
</h1>
<p>

It cannot be denied that social networking sites enable us to make friends with total strangers

 and stay in touch with family and friends living far away. However, excessive use of the Internet is
leading to decreased social interaction in the real world. In the virtual world there is no need to reveal
one’s identity or appearance and, perhaps, this cover of anonymity instils confidence and a feeling of
self-worth in youngsters. But these youngsters feel ill at ease when they are face to face with people and
may not know how to carry out an ordinary Social conversation. Social skills, thus, are on the decline
with the advent of the Internet. There is very little personal interaction with others.

</p>


<h1>
	9.2.2.6 Blurring of distinction between Office Time and Home Time
</h1>
<p>

It might be convenient to work from home, either part time or full time, but sometimes family
life is affected adversely. People invariably work on their laptops even at airports and on beaches and
in hotels, even when they are on a holiday with their family.

<h1>
	9.2.2.7 Unethical usage of the Internet,page no : 124

<p>
	Students often ‘copy’ and ‘paste’ large chunks of information found on the Internet and do
not bother even to acknowledge the source when submitting assignments. Many may not be aware that
this constitutes Plagiarism and is unethical. It is also becoming increasingly common to use
bluetooth
devices for malpractices in the examination hall with help from experts who supply the answers from
outside, as shown in the classic film Munnabhai MBBS.
</p>

<h1>
	9.2.2.8 Easy access to Indecent Sites
</h1>

<p>
	Youngsters have easy access to sites which may contain indecent or sleazy clips or movies.
The ready availability of pornography is a matter of grave concern. It may not be a coincidence that
some of the most brutal crimes against women have taken place in the recent past in India soon after the
juvenile criminals viewed pornography clips.
</p>

<h1>
	9.2.2.9 Information on the Internet may be Inaccurate

<p>

 The information available on websites may not always be accurate and may need to be cross-
checked.

<h1>
	9.2.2.10 5afety of Children Compromised,page no : 125
</h1>
<p>

Children are often unaware of the dangers and risks associated with social networking sites.
They reveal personal details and passwords to strangers they meet on the web. Some youngsters set
out to meet their new ‘friends’ in person, not realizing that they may be walking into a trap. The ‘friend’
often turns out to be a person who has deliberately created a false profile of himself on the net in order
to lure innocent children. He has criminal intentions and may even be a member of a ruthless gang
involved in child trafficking.

</p>
<h1>
	9.2.2.11 Fraudulent Profiles, False Job Offers etc.
</h1>
<p>

False profiles are pasted on matrimonial sites to entice gullible people. The fraud is often
detected too late. Similarly, job seekers are lured into paying large amounts of money in the belief that
they will get a lucrative job. After the money is paid, the site is shut down, the mobile phone is switched
off and the “job provider” vanishes. There are instances of people who are made to believe that they
have won thousands of dollars in a lottery. They are directed to put lakhs of rupees into an unknown
bank account as “clearance” charges. (Probably you can complete the rest of the story!)
</p>

<h1>
	9.2.2.12 Hacking of Accounts
</h1>
<p>

Malicious software or ‘malware’is used to disrupt, damage or steal personal data from the
host computer or network. Common types of malware include viruses and worms. The virus is installed
when one clicks an infected email attachment or downloads such a file. The virus spreads when the
software or document it is attached to is transferred from one computer to another through file sharing.
The virus may corrupt data and may even delete data on the computer. Sometimes sensitive personal
and financial data is stolen, such as passwords and banking account details. This is called Phishing.
Money is siphoned out of the accounts. It is extremely difficult to trace the criminals involved in this sort
of activity as the operation is often conducted from some other country. It is necessary, therefore, to
take reasonable precautions to protect the computer from malware.
</p>

<h1>
	9.2.2.13 Lack of Physical Exercise
</h1>

<p>
	Adolescents spend so much time on the Internet that they do not get enough physical exercise.
They are interested in playing virtual games rather than taking part in real sports. The lack of exercise
leads to problems like obesity and, in turn, increases the risk for diseases like hypertension and diabetes.
Also, as teenagers tend to slouch over their computers for long stretches of time, they may develop eye
problems and muscle stiffness .

	9.2.2.14 Increase of Electro-Pollution, page no : 126
</h1>

<p>
	It is a major challenge today to find safe and eco-friendly modes of e-waste disposal. Most
modern appliances such as laptops, mobile phones and TVs are simply dumped in the dustbin after
being used for a few years. They end up in landfills and create mountains of e-waste. Many of these
devices contain harmful metals like lead and platinum which endanger the health of all living organisms.

<h1>
	9.2.3 Guidelines for the Use of the Internet by Teens
</h1>

<p>
	The Internet is a fantastic tool of modern technology but adolescents should follow certain
guidelines in their own interest and safety, particularly while navigating social networking sites.
</p>
<p>

. Teenagers should spend only a limited amount of time on their computer. A computer
cannot be a substitute for a friend or family member.

. Teenagers should spend time outdoors in games and social interaction with friends and
family. They should not remain cooped up in their home with laptops during Holidays.

. Teenagers should use the Internet mostly for information and partly for recreation. They
should make ethical use of the information on the web.

. Teenagers should have a frank discussion with their parents about various aspects of Internet
usage, such as amount of time spent daily on the net, timings and purpose.

. Teenagers should agree to parental supervision and frequent checks of what they have
been surfing or doing on the net.

. Teenagers should promise not to visit sites that are not suitable for them. They should
avoid sites that are indecent and which contain ‘adult content’.

. Passwords should NEVER be revealed to anyone, except to parents. They should not be
shared even with friends.

. Personal details such as name,address, school or college, telephone number etc should
NEVER be disclosed to strangers on networking sites.

. Photos should NEVER be shared with strangers.

<p>
. Teenagers should avoid meeting online acquaintances except with parental approval. If
parental approval is obtained, they should fix the meeting at a public place and also ensure
that a parent is present.

. Teenagers should immediately inform parents if anything inappropriate or odd takes place
while interacting with others on social networks.

. Emails from unknown persons should not be opened as they may contain spam (irrelevant
and unsolicited messages, often for the purpose of advertising) or malware. The malware
may disable the computer totally or steal sensitive personal data. Anti-virus software
should be installed. Files should be downloaded only from safe sites.

. Credit cards of parents should not be used without prior permission to buy goods online.
Goods should be bought only from reliable sites.

. Teenagers should observe ‘netiquette’ i.e net etiquette. They should be polite and should
avoid posting mean or nasty comments. They should never threaten or intimidate anyone
on the Internet. Such behaviour, termed cyber-bullying, is offensive and may even be
deemed a criminal act. There are several instances of children who have been driven to
suicide because of their inability to deal with Cyberbullying.

. Laptops should be used carefully.When their life is over they should be handed over at a
place for recycling e—waste.

9.3 MOBILE PHONES: ETHICS AND ETIQUETTE
</h1>
<p>

The first mobile phone in India was launched by Motorola in 1995. The rest, as they say, is
history. The advent of mobile phones ushered in a revolution. The use of mobile phones spread rapidly,
permeating through all strata of society. Today the number of landlines is decreasing drastically while
the number of mobile phones is increasing exponentially. If, among poorer classes, every family has a
mobile phone, among the upper classes every member of the family has a mobile phone. Gone are
the days when a phone was merely an instrument with which one could talk with others. Today we have
phones to cater to every specific need, fancy and budget. ‘Smart Phones’ are becoming almost common
place. These phones have a relatively larger screen compared to basic models and can perform many
functions of a computer. The number of smart phones available is mind boggling not only in terms of
features, costs and looks but also with reference to the OS or operating system used, such as AppleiOS,
Android, Symbian, Windows, and Blackberry OS etc. Phones are incorporating more and more
sophisticated features and software ‘apps’ or applications with each passing day. With the use of
Internet in phones, it is common today to see people checking their email, posting ‘selfies’ on
FaceBook,
paying their utility bills, sending instant messages, checking out stock prices or weather forecasts,
looking for directions on Global Positioning System(GPS), all in the span of a few minutes while
simultaneously talking to someone on BlueTooth! And, yes, incidentally the person may be driving a car
while doing all this. Mobile phones are a craze, especially among teens, and are viewed as status
symbols which need to be upgraded every few months.

<p>

. Teenagers should remember that the primary purpose of a mobile phone is to stay in touch
with the family. They should not succumb to peer-pressure or make comparisons with
those who have fancy gadgets. They should not force parents to buy them expensive
phones.

. Teenagers should discuss with their parents the amount of time they can use the phone
daily and the expense involved. They should keep within those limits.

. Mobile phones should not be used in class. They should either be switched off or kept in
silent mode.

. It is impolite and discourteous to talk loudly over the phone in public places such as movie
halls, restaurants, malls and trains.

. Talking over the mobile, checking mail and sending messages should be completely avoided
during formal occasions such as meetings (and during one’s own marriage!).

. Talking on the phone while driving, even on BlueTooth, is dangerous and also illegal in
most countries. Texting while driving is doubly so.

. Youngsters should avoid too much texting on the mobile. Excessive texting results invariably
in the excessive use of abbreviations. After a while even spoken and written language gets
distorted. Also, too much texting can damage the thumb and cause musculoskeletal  damage.

. The use of the phone should be avoided while the battery is being charged as there have
been instances of spurious batteries exploding.

. It is advisable to speak not more than half an hour on the mobile every day. Mobile phones,
like laptops, electric hair driers and shavers emit electro-magnetic radiation. Some scientific
studies have linked the excessive use of talking on mobile phones with a greater incidence
of headaches, stress and even brain tumours.

	. It is rude to look into the messages of others or even their list of contacts without their
permission.

. It is advisable to use a password for opening the phone. If the phone is lost the mobile
service provider Should be informed at once and a police complaint too should be lodged.
There have been several instances when stolen SIM cards have been used for criminal
purposes.

. Back up all data such as contacts and photos on a pen drive or as a hard copy (on paper)
or on your computer.

. If the mobile is a ‘smart phone’ and has Internet connectivity, all the guidelines related to
 the proper use of the Internet should be observed. It is estimated that as in April 2014
India had 185 million mobile Internet connections.

. Avoid using the smart phone for banking and other sensitive transactions in public places
having wireless connectivity as data can be compromised.

	9.4 SOCIAL NETWORKING: ETHICS AND ETIQUETTE
</h1>

<p>
	It is possible to communicate with friends and relatives across the globe with utmost ease
through social networking sites like Facebook, Myspace, Netlog and his. We can chat with them and
send instant messages, either individually, or even in groups, besides holding video conferences through
services like Skype and Google Hangout. We can also upload our photos and videos. It is common
today to find youngsters uploading photos of dosas or pizzas ordered at a restaurant and uploading

them on Facebook or Google+ with a comment, even before they take a bite of the food placed in
front of them.
</p>
<p>

FaceBook, a popular social networking site founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg, has
more than a billion users worldwide. It is open to anyone who is more than 13 years old. Users of the
site can create and customize their profiles and upload photos, videos and information about themselves.
They can accept other users, including relatives, friends, colleagues, teachers as well as total strangers
as ‘Friends’. ‘Friends’ can browse the profiles of other ‘friends’, and write messages or post comments

on ‘walls’ which can be viewed by all the other ‘friends’. Privacy settings can be customized for different
 types of ‘friends’.

in touch with friends and family. They should not make friends with strangers or people
who promise lucrative jobs like modelling careers or movie roles.

. Teenagers should discuss with their parents if anyone unknown tries to make “friends” with
them on a social networking site.

. Social networking sites should not be used to post offensive messages about friends or to

gossip about others.

. Inappropriate photos of oneself or one’s friends should not be posted.

. Personal details like address and telephone number and passwords should never be revealed
 on social networking sites.

<p>

The human race has progressed gloriously over the centuries. It has continuously and
consistently strived to reshape its future and give its young ones a better tomorrow. At each juncture of
civilization, it has realized that the world needs better future citizens. The explorations and achievements
in this direction certainly make us proud today.
</p>
<p>

We don’t have to go too far to cite the magnanimous achievements inherited from the past.
The twentieth century offered us unparalleled multi-faceted grth and development. Space was
conquered, and human capacities challenged and even overcome by computers. Apartheid and
colonialism vanished. The concept of the global village became visible. The denizens of the globe
became neighbours. Human drudgery Was reduced. Though a lot can be detailed on the brighter side,
there is an extremely dark Side as well. Twenty-three percent of the world’s population is still living in
extreme poverty. Everyday 799 million people in developing countries - about 18 percent of the world
population - go hungry (UNDP, 2003). One in six of the world’s adults is illiterate. Primary school
enrolment still stands at 84 per cent. The richest 5 per cent of the world’s population have incomes 114
times more than that of the poorest 5 percent. Everyday more than 30,000 children around the world
die of preventable diseases. In Botswana, more than a third of adults suffer from HIV/AIDS (UNDP,
2002). Nearly a quarter of the world’s populatiOn remains hungry. Nearly three quarters of world  I
resources are still cornered by less than a quarter of the people. And the list goes on.
</p>



<pagenum page="normal" id="page000133">133</pagenum>

<p>
	We stand at a stage when the world has enough to offer a good quality of life to each of its
inhabitants. Why, then, is the globe not a place full of peace, equality and social justice? Why is the gap
between the haves and the have nots growing consistently and alarmingly? It would seem that the
critical ingredients of a fulsome life have been lost somewhere. Materialistic pursuits and possessions
appear to have become the prime goal of life. We have grown in our mental horizons and sharpened
our skills but have primarily used them for personal aggrandizement and personal growth. So while a
few are able to corner the major chunk of resources, the majority is left to suffer in misery. According
to the UN Millennium Declaration (2000) ‘We recognize that, in addition to our separate responsibilities
to our individual societies, we have a collective responsibility to uphold the principles of human dignity,
equality and equity at the global level. As leaders we have a duty therefore to all the world’s people,
especially the most vulnerable and, in particular, the children of the world, to whom the future belongs.”

</p>
<p>
	  While we have covered a lot of ground to achieve the goal of human development, the

challenge still remains enormous in magnitude. The war against poverty, unemployment, exploitation
and ill-health often gets relegated to the background as the battle of political egos, mutual distrust,
religious differences, bigotry and fanaticism loom large globally at one place or other. Millions of
refugees and victims of violent conflicts have probably one question to ask - why has all the progress
and growth been so mechanical, materialistic and self-centered? What has happened to the basic
human instinct of ‘love thy neighbour? ’ 'Why have human beings lagged behind in growing spiritually?
What has happened to the moral, ethical and humanistic values preached by every civilization everywhere
from times immemorial? Efforts to establish interfaith dialogues, initiatives towards nurturance and
inculcation of values and efforts to make people learn ‘how to live together’ are not bearing much
visible fruits. How could one delineate strategies as to the causes and the reasons for such inhuman,
even anti-human developments?
</p>
<p>

Everywhere, practically in every discussion and interaction, one single issue emerged most
prominently in different forms: What has happened to our value system? Why is education not
contributing towards inculcation, nurturance and development of values? If education can’t accept this
challenge who else would? Who else could?
</p>

<p>
	The absence of human values, negligence of duties and disregard towards societal obligations
are the root causes of disparity and disharmony in society. There is an urgent need to internalize human
values as there is no other alternative to a value based approach to life to ensure a better tomorrow.
And, who else to begin with, than our younger generation? The famous saying holds true here - The

world we leave our children will depend on the children we leave to the world.

<h1>
	10.1.1 Why do we need Ethics?
</h1>

<p>
	Man is a social animal. We cannot imagine a society without human beings. It is natural for

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000134">134</pagenum>

<p>
	all humans to form into families and for them in turn to form into societies. Every society forms its own
traditions/ conventions and principles. To getherness or social life is possible only when everyone in the
society follows the principles and observes the traditions/ conventions. It is considered anti—social or
unethical if anybody goes against the principles or breaks with the conventions/ traditions. Everybody in
society has some responsibilities as well as some rights.
</p>

<p>
	Nature has an intrinsic and inseparable bond with human beings without which human life is
impossible. Air, water, food, clothes, etc., which are essential for human life, are from nature. Hence
we should recognize that nature and society influence human life. In view of this human beings should
take responsibility for society and nature. In other words, they should contribute to the development of
the society by discharging their duties as responsible citizens. Similarly they should protect nature and
participate in its development. In every society, there are moral principles that decide what is right and

what is wrong. The survival and development of a society depends on the execution of these principles.

We should understand ethics in this context; it tells us what we should do and what we should not.
</p>
<h1>
	10.1.2 The Meaning of Ethics
</h1>

<p>
	Greek philosophers such as Socrates and Aristotle were the first to draw attention to what we
refer to as ethics. Socrates’ views on the subject, known chiefly through the writings of Plato, suggest
that the study of the human condition is the most important activity for a human being. The importance
of ethics is thus stated in no uncertain terms by Plato. He viewed ethical behaviour as that pertaining to
the practice of certain virtues, and as that directed towards increasing the totality of happiness in the
human condition. By happiness, Plato means, an absence of problems for the community, not just for
an individual. Since the individual is embedded in the social structure, moral conduct is behaviour which
is in the interest of the society, and in accordance with those values which minimise problems for the

society, such as justice, courage, reverence and temperance or soundness of mind
(i.e., moderation).
</p>

<p>
	An individual is said to be virtuous when she customarily or habitually acts in accordance with
 a specific approved principle, such as always being truthful, or never appropriating another’s property.
Plato spoke of virtues as having a unity, in that there is a considerable overlap between the behaviours
and attitudes implied by different virtues. Thus, virtuous conduct finds its roots in certain dispositions
and attitudes of the mind. This is the attitude that needs to be inculcated in children if they are to grow into citizens capable and willing to take the responsibility for themselves and for their societies.
</p>

<p>
	Deliberations on the matter of ethics have been undertaken by others as well. Aristotle focused
 on the holistic way in which values such as friendship, virtue, work, etc. fit together as a whole. Generally,

ethics is regarded as the totality of principles, rules and conduct that society deems good, and that aids
the progress of the society.
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000135">135</pagenum>

<h1>
	10.1.3 The Importance of Ethics,page no: 135
</h1>
<p>

Few people would deny the necessity of ethics. Ethical conduct implies not merely conformity
 with Values of society because of fear of retribution, but behaviour in accordance with societal values
which have been internalised and accepted as one’s own. Ethical behaviour also demands consistency
of conduct and belief in a principle. An individual is ethical if he behaves in accordance with a principle
at all times and not just when it suits him.
</p>

<p>
	If the above two conditions were absent, some of the very foundations on which the society is
based, such as trust, acceptance and cooperation would crumble. However, even when a society has
a set of clearly defined moral principles, conflict is not necessarily avoided. This is because ethics  develops within specific social frameworks and keep changing as societies change.
Thus, two societies
are likely to uphold different. even opposing principles and priorities, which can be a cause of conflict

between them, even though certain primary ethical values maybe almost universal in nature.
</p>

<h1>
	10.1.4 The Difference between Morals and Ethics
</h1>

<p>
	Ethics is a branch  of phiiosophy which deals with matters of morality, including approving and
recommending certain actions and disapproving and condemning others, in view of the general states
and interests of the society. Thus, ethics deals with actions as well as reasons for approving or disapproving
anything. Ethics is concerned with the ideal behaviour of whole groups of people, and basic frameworks

that guide commonly accepted principles or codes of conduct in the society.
</p>

<p>
	The term ‘morals’, often taken to be synonymous with the term ‘ethics’, refers to the accepted
principles, rules, codes of conduct of an individual or a group. Thus, morals refer to individual principles,
while ethics refers to general frameworks. Ethics represents the whole reasoning behind society’s way
of functioning.
</p>
<p>

Following these principles would qualify a human being as being moral, and if the individual

does not follow these rules he/she is viewed as an immoral person.
</p>

<h1>
	10.1.5 The Operation of Ethics
</h1>
<p>

Everybody in society absorbs values or morals from their families or society through observation
of life situations and by participating in them. But to put them into practice is a personal factor which
may change according to the context. In any situation, individuals behave in accordance with their
previous personal experiences, the values inherited from their families, or what is accepted and what is
valued as good behaviour in their society. This behaviour should be considered a matter of ethics.
 Though values are universal, putting them into practice should be considered a matter of sagacity and
wisdom, and is subject to personal discretion.
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000136">136</pagenum>

<h1>
	10.1.6 Ethical Development,page no : 136
</h1>
<p>

When people have good conduct and behave in conformity with the standards of the society,
we call it ethical behaviour. This can neither be taught nor learnt in the way other school subjects are
taught. It develops in individuals as a result of their family background, influence of their peer group,
and the influence of the society in which they live. Let us take a look at the following situations:
</p>
<p>

Situation - 1: Sudhakar's father was a drunkard Every day he would come home
and create a nuisance. Sudhakar watched this every day and sometimes went to his
friends’ houses as he could not bear it. This made him take a decision not to take to,

alcohol under any circumstances; and he has stood by his word till date.
</p>

<p>
	Situation — 2: Some relatives came to Ranga Rao's house. He was not courteous
and was very impatient for as long as they stayed in their house. He would behave
 in the same way whenever he had some visitors. Now his son in school behaves in
the same manner. He cannot mingle with anybody and he does not visit the houses

of any of his peers.
</p>

<p>
	From the above situations, we can see that the families influenced the behaviour of the children.
 While one of them learned to keep himself away from a bad habit after having observed its ill effects,
the other child acquired his father’s behaviour and took him as a model. Hence we can say that the
following factors influence the inculcation of values.
. Observation

. Participation

. Discussion

. Inspiration from others

. Fear of punishment (if the rules are broken)

. Serious influence of some incidents or situations
</p>
<p>

Clearly, education is the best means of inculcating ethical thinking and behaviour. In his dialogues
concerning ethics Plato suggests that education is one of the essential instruments to develop certain
preferences and dispositions among citizens, and thus inculcation of values for the progress and
preservation of society is one of the key aims ofeducation. Similarly, wrong doing is also best addressed
not through retribution, but through education. Importance of inculcation of ethics, or moral development
has been echoed time and again by other thinkers, such as John Dewey, who posited that education
was a process of forming “fundamental dispositions.” Mahatma Gandhi is also frequently quoted in this
respect — “The purpose of all knowledge is to build up character”. We should note that values and
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000137">137</pagenum>
<h1>
	 page no : 137
</h1>
<p>
	ethics cannot be taught by direct teaching. In newspapers and magazines, we often read many good
quotations, moral sayings/principles instructing us to help others, not to tell lies, not to take dowry, not
to take bribes, etc., but such practices continue to thrive in our society. For any value to be developed,
it should be practised with regularity and without lapses. Gradually, it becomes a habit and then culminates
in character. People, whether in a family, or a society, or any other place, develop their character only
through practising values. It is important, therefore, to discuss various strategies and programmes to
achieve moral development by asking questions like: what can schools do? What values should be
developed in children? What values should be developed in the light of human rights?
</p>

<h1>
	10.1.7 Which Values and Why?
</h1>

<p>
	 India is a symbol of diversity with different languages, religions, castes, and classes. Indian
society is marching forward in accordance with the principle ‘unity in diversity’. Even so, this multiplicity
leads to various differences, conflicts and clashes. Differences are cropping up between people of
different castes, religions, languages, areas; between the rich and the poor; the urban and the rural, etc.

In a country with so much diversity, it is very important to live in peace. The preamble of our constitution
affirms this.
</p>

<p>
	 The architects of our constitution wished that the people of India live in peace with justice,
liberty, equality, and fraternity. The people of the Indian society should act according to the basic principles
of the constitution. They have to shoulder their responsibilities and discharge their duties. Only such
people can contribute to the development of the Indian society.
</p>

<h1>
	10.1.8 Values related to Responsibility
</h1>

<p>
	Working together, respecting others, respecting other languages, accepting one’s own abilities,
talents, and weaknesses; protecting public and private properties; facing challenges with hope and
resilience; being optimistic; sincerity, self-discipline, team spirit are some of the values that should be
developed among children. The aim should be to develop awareness that one’s actions, however
small,
play a role in the future of the nation; that one can influence what happens in society and should participate  accordingly.
</p>

<h1>
	10.1.9 Values related to Social Responsibility
</h1>
<p>

These values include the spirit of equality, co-operation, protection of culture, following rules
and regulations, religious tolerance, peace, living together, the ability to give importance to others and
help them, aspiring to inner peace, life style values, sensitivity towards nature, preservation and
conservation of nature.

</p>
<p>
	Critical and Creative Thinking Values: Critical Thinking is the ability to distinguish between
fact, opinion and belief to recognize bias and prejudice: to identify issues and problems as well as the
assumption in an argument and to reason correctly. Creative Thinking is to think laterally and approach
problems from multiple perspectives.

</p>
<p>
	 Reflection:To stand back from a problem and identify its component parts to effectively
monitor thought processes and produce appropriate strategies for dealing with particular problem.
</p>
<p>

Dialectical Thinking:Thinking about more than one point of View for understanding both
points of View; being able to construct an argument from either point of View based on knowledge of the other.

</p>

<h1>
	10.1.10 Aesthetic Values
</h1>

<p>
	These values include appreciation of nature; adaptability, appreciation of unity and diversity;
a spirit of appreciation and gratitude; appreciation of others’ cultures, languages, living
styles, adaptability;

respect and care for harmony; aesthetic expression in day to day acts, ideas, feelings and emotions.
</p>

<p>
	All citizens should implement the values of the constitution along with the conventions/traditions
and principles of their society. Indian society is intrinsically diverse. It has a multiplicity of languages,
religions, castes and classes, so respecting diversity and achieving ‘unity in diversity’ should become the
second nature of every Indian. Since sensitivity to the environment and the development of the society
are crucial,every individual should become a good citizen who protects the environment and contributes
to the development of the society. While some values can be imbibed through family and society,
others can be inculcated through education.

	10.2 RIGHT THINKING
</h1>
<p>

The mind we have is a wonderful thing. You may have heard that it is like a computer. You may
have also heard that we use only a portion of its capability. We can improve our thinking skills by
understanding specific types of thinking, how they work, and practising to improve our thinking abilities.
If we become more conscious about those skills, we become better as a person, family member, and
Worker. We will look at two types of thinking skills, critical thinking and creative thinking, that help us to
solve problem and make decisions. The more flexible and efficient our thinking, the more effective will
we be in life.

 <h1>
	10.3  RIGHT UNDERSTANDING,page no : 139
</h1>

<p>
	Right understanding is the first step in the Buddha’s Noble Eightfold Middle Path. The English word ‘understanding’ means, literally, ‘to stand under’, to be very close to something so as to get to
know it well. The Pali word ditthi literally means ‘vision.’
</p>

<p>

Therefore, Right Understanding means cultivating those qualities of the mind which will allow
one to have a complete and realistic apprehension of things, or as the Buddha put it, ‘a knowledge and
vision of things as they really are.’ Some of the attitudes that can help the development of Right
Understanding include; trying to get a direct experience of something rather than relying on the opinions
of others, not having preconceived ideas, not jumping to conclusions, being open to different explanations,
taking time to draw conclusions, being ready to change one’s opinion when presented with facts that
contradict it, not mistaking a part for the whole, etc. Right Understanding is a process rather than a
fixed idea, belief or opinion. And the culmination and finality of this process will be
enlightenment.

10.4 REFLECTIVE THINKING
</h1>

<p>

Many courses and programmes of study in higher education require the reflective integration of
learning which is derived from experience or practice. Even where this is not the case, reflection as a general
skill can form part of the learning process and the ability to use this will enhance the quality of learning.
</p>

<h1>
	 10.4.1 What is gained by Reflection?
</h1>
<p>

Reflection goes beyond just gaining knowledge, by
. I exploring the foundations of that knowledge,
. strengthening understanding, and
. increasing awareness of the values and attitudes that influence it.
</p>
<p>
	It is important to remember that reflection is a dynamic process. It is not about being passive,
staying where you are and looking back, (although time to be still may be an important part of it) but an

active engagement with knowledge and experience. So, by reflecting, you are able to construct new
and deeper understanding and to articulate knowledge in a more meaningful way.
</p>

<h1>
	  10.4.2 The Reflective Process
</h1>

<p>
	One of the most commonly quoted models for understanding the process of reflection is a

model developed by Boud, Keogh and Walker ( 1985). This model highlights that experiences in learning

combine behaviour, ideas and feelings and the all of these aspects need to be examined in the process

of reflection.

The process has three stages:

</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000140">140</pagenum>

<h1>
	 page no : 140
</h1>
<p>
. returning to experience - a detailed recounting or recollection of the events

. attending to the feelings, both positive and negative, that have been prompted by the
experience
. re-evaluating that experience in the light of these stages and the learner’s intent, and

self-knowledge, bringing in new knowledge that has been gained through the process.
</p>

<h1>
	10.4.3 Possible Barriers to Reflection
</h1>

<p>
	There are a number of things that can get in the way of reflection. Some of them may be

external to the learner, (people, environment, wider personal circumstances, social forces, including

issues that might be associated with experiences of discrimination and oppression) and some may be

internal (these might inelude previous negative experiences, assumptions about ability or lack of it,
confidence and self-awareness).
</p>
<p>

Such barriers might be:

. assumptions about what is/is not possible
. assumptions about how to learn
. lack of confidence/ self confidence
. previous (negative) experiences
. low expectations of others and of self
. inadequate preparation
. lack of amenable environment
. lack of space/time
. tiredness
. unclear/ ambivalent intent
</p>
<p>

It is likely that barriers and potential barriers will vary between individuals and between different
situations and it may not always be possible to change some of them.
</p>

<h1>
	10.4.4 What are the skills and qualities needed to be reflective?
</h1>

<p>
	Reflection requires an approach which is

. being tolerant of diversity of ideas - not everyone will think the way you do, not
everyone interprets or understands the world in the way you do

. being curious - there has to be a willingness to ask questions, to want to find out

. being patient (not jumping to conclusions) - just as there are no simple answers, there
are no instant answers either and your ideas and understanding may Well change over
time
</p>

<pagenum page="normal" id="page000141">141</pagenum>
  <h1>
	 page no : 141
</h1>
<p>
	. being open - willingness to absorb what is happening

. being honest - you need to be honest with yourself and this includes being honest
about doubts and uncertainty or lack of knowledge. Learning cannot take place if you
pretend to know what you do not understand.
</p>

<h1>
	Strategies for reflection
</h1>

<p>
	Some useful strategies that may be used in developing skills for reflection include:
</p>
<h1>
	10.4.4.1 Use of Learning Logs
</h1>
<p>

A learning log can be a valuable tool. Different courses may provide different formats for
learning logs, but the type of questions you can ask are:

.  Event/Activity - e. g. What happened? What was the sequence of events? What role
did I play? What tasks did I perform?

. Reflection / Analysis - What have I learned from this experience / activity? What issues
or questions did it raise for me? What positive and negative feelings did it evoke?

. Underpinning Knowledge And Understanding - What knowledge / theory helps me to
understand this event / activity? What source materials are useful to this?

. Issues For Future Development And Learning - What else do I need to know to
increase my understanding, how can my knowledge / practice be improved? Are there
any unresolved issues?

. Key Message — What is the main message that comes from this reflection? Used well,

learning logs can be a rich source of learning and evidence of learning.
</p>

<h1>
	10.4.4.2 Debriefing with colleagues or learning partner
</h1>

<p>
	Simply talking over events and feelings can be a valuable part of a learning process. If your

reflection involves talking about work with people you may need to be careful about issues of confidentiality
and boundaries.
</p>

<h1>
	10.4.4.3 Focus on specific incidents
(critical incident analysis, process record)
</h1>
<p>
	There is a value in writing down in detail not just what happened, but the how, why, what,

when of the process including thoughts and feelings. It can seem a laborious task, but usually worth the
effort.

</p>
<pagenum page="normal" id="page000142">142</pagenum>


<h1>
	10.4.4.4 Work placement supervision
</h1>
<p>

In a situation where reflection is part of practice learning, supervision by another (for example
a practice teacher) is an opportunity for reflection and learning. It used well both student and teacher
experience learning.
</p>

<h1>
	10.4.4.5 Action research
</h1>
<p>

This is particularly relevant when learning from practice experience. Research and evaluation of
practice, and as part of practice, will enhance Understanding and can improve practice. Use the opportunity
to find out (research) about the work you are doing. How is its effectiveness measured? How far are goals
and objectives being achieved? What are the implications for re-assessment and change?
</p>

<h1>
	 10.5 CRITICAL THINKING
</h1>
<p>

Critical thinking is exercising or involving careful judgement or evaluation, e.g., judging the
feasibility of an idea or product. Critical thinking is a very important skill to develop. We can analyze
and understand many things in this fast-paced world and move ahead in life only if we have the ability to
think critically.
</p>

<h1>
	10.5.1 Critical thinkers are able to do the following things
</h1>
<p>

. Be open minded about new ideas.
. Be intellectually independent.
. Know when there is a need for more information about something.
. Ask questions.
. Base their judgments on evidence.
. Look for connections between subjects.
. Analyze and understand concepts, information, and behavior.
. Break things down and separate fact from opinion.
. Question everything that doesn’t make sense.
. Try to avoid common mistakes in reasoning.
. Be honest with themselves.
. Overcome confusion.
. Try to separate emotional thinking from logical thinking.
</p>


<h1>
	10.6 CREATIVE THINKING
</h1>
<p>

A working definition of creative thinking is having unusual ideas and innovative thoughts, and
being able to put things together in new and imaginative ways. It is like thinking outside of the box. The
following exercise will help you to understand our usual pattern of thinking and how you can begin to
see things in a different way “outside of the box.”
</p>


<pagenum page="normal" id="page000143">143</pagenum>
   <h1>
	   page no : 143
</h1>
<p>

Creative thinking is a great skill to develop. Your ability to develop

new and imaginative ideas, concepts, plans, and other things will make you a

valued person and team member. Developing this skill helps you to solve

problems better. Many innovations have been made possible only because of

 creative thinking.

</p>
<p>
	Creative thinking calls for taking risks and stepping past what we know. The more you practice this
skill, the better you get at it. Here are some other tips to help you to develop your
creative—think ing skills:
. Don’t get hooked on finding the right answer. There can be many right answers in a
creative process; it depends on your point of view.

. Don’t always be logical. Sometimes we need to look at something in a very different or
not so logical way to create a better way.
. Break the rules (of thinking) sometimes. New breakthroughs have happened because
of someone not always following the rules.
. Be impractical. If we are always practical. we will always see things the same way.
Sometime we have to step out of what is usual or safe.
. Allow yourself to be playful. Creativity is a fun process; so let go and step outside of
the box.
. Be a little foolish. It’s okay, that is part of freeing your mind to think new thoughts.
. Allow yourself to fail. You get better with practice.
. Always consider yourself to be creative. This goes to our never saying we cannot do
something; we need to always try.
</p>
<p>
	Thinking skills are extremely important for all of us. We need to push ourselves in this area to be all we can. Remember that we are only using a portion of this wonderful computer called our mind. It is

like the picture of the brain with the light switch—it's time to turn on our minds to reach our full potential.

PROJECT WORK IN ETHICS ,page no : 144
</h1>
<p>

The aim of project work is to sensitize students about some of the issues that are dealt with in
the textbook through field trips, interviews and discussions, and to encourage them to reflect on these
issues as responsible citizens of the nation.

</p>

<p>
	The list of ideas given below serves merely as a guideline and is by no means either exhaustive
or binding. It is left to the discretion of junior colleges to choose projects which are suitable for their
students, depending on the location of the college. the background of the students etc. The only
prerequisite is that teachers should not dictate essays but encourage students to actually
participate in a project, no matter how small or simple it is.
</p>

<h1>
	GROUP PROJECTS (20 Marks)

</h1>
<p>
	Students could go on a local field trip and submit an account in about 5 pages. Students can
be divided into groups of 5 and one written account can be submitted per group. Different groups can
undertake different projects so that the logistics are manageable and there is also sharing of experiences/
ideas. Students are advised to prepare a list of questions before hand so that they are more focussed.
</p>
<p>
	Some suggestions:

1.  A field trip/ visit to any place in the town, village or district (in which the college is located)
that is associated with a person of noble ideals. The person need not be famous. He/ She
could be a philanthropist/ educationist/ social worker. For eg. students in Hyderabad can be
taken to Bapu Ghat, Langar Hauz.

2. A visit to the Gram Panchayat / Mandal Parishad Office/ Zilla Parishad Office/ Municipal
Corporation or any local governing body. (Talk to some of the officials and find out about
various aspects related to the functioning of that institution - meet members of the public -
